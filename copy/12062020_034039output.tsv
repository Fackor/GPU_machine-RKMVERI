Thanks for your help. DPW does a great job in town but this clogged pipe issue isn't going to be resolved by dumping gravel into the hole.	Drainage / Storm Water

It HAS to be a health hazard for the homes on either side or behind them. Bottom line; this home on our street ought to be held regularly accountable for allowing this nightmare to recur every few months. It ought not take their neighbors reporting them repeatedly to keep their property clean....or at least not a health hazard to the other residents in the area. Thanks for allowing the rant.

You closed the complaint before I could comment. To Jane, the problem is not the tightness of a structure, it's the direction the structure faces. Brick and other walls completely deflect sounds. When the drunken parties were going on at the reunion center, I was completely overwhelmed by the noise while neighbors 50 ft. away couldn't hear it. There was nothing but air between me and the noise and my neighbors had brick bldgs blocking the sound. It will be impossible for the city to make them heard by everyone. It's a primitive system I thought was abandoned years ago. Phone and email alerts are a possibility but then, there are the ones that have neither, but I've observed that even the town's poorest and most backward residents have a cell phone, so the technology is in place if it was just used.

On 9/4/2018 a very large city truck & trailer worked in the cul de sac at the end of Broadway. (Many gas line flags have been placed in our area). Glad for the city services to improve our streets. 
FYI...these ruts (see pic) are in my yard this morning 9/5/2018. A very large truck (not sure if it was our city truck or not though) ran up onto my yard trying to negotiate my cul de sac on 27th Street. 
Made me mad since the driver was too hurried to back up & remain on the street surface & instead ran up into my yard to continue. 
Thank You.  I am a happy citizen of Beaumont.	Other

A few months ago they where fixing some lines in the ally way and moved the trash cans to the front of the houses. They have been done in the alley way for sometime now and the trash cans are still in the front of the property. The issue is we have had slot of rain and this is a flood zone area so every time it rains the trash cans go floating down the road way bumping into vehicles. Also it is a pretty narrow street and they take up some much needed room.	Trash Container Issue
Truck has been on jacks in roadway on the west side of Mulberry Street at North 3rd now for three weeks.  This is an operable vehicle that has a wheel maintenance issue, however, considering there is private property that could be utilized for such maintenance, it is inappropriate for this vehicle to "junk up" a public street and impact the atmosphere of our neighborhood.

We would like to know what it would take to have a Traffic Arrow installed at this location for traffic traveling East to West. The wait time for someone to turn left during high traffic times is long. Especially during the morning commute. Traffic can back up by a numerous amount of vehicles. To install a left turn arrow at this location would be a lot safer all the way around for those turning and for oncoming traffic. I have seen numerous near misses at this location. Wanted to see if we could get anything done about this before there is a tragic accident.	Traffic Signals

The left turn signal only flashes yellow, but doesn't turn to green arrow even when several cars are in queue. During busy times it is very difficult for even one vehicle to be able to turn left. Other cars will often risk it and turn on the red. It's a dangerous intersection without the left turn green arrow.	Traffic Signals
re-surface on S.R. 193 under I-15 in Clearfield is slippery, especially Eastbound Right Lane. Along with myself, I have noticed other vehicles see to slide similar to wet/icy conditions.	Other
The shoulders of SR-193 in Clearfield have a large amount of gravel in them.  (new section between main street and freeport center)
This makes riding a bike dangerous since you have to ride closer to traffic to avoid the gravel. (gravel and a skinny-tire bike don't play well together)	Road Debris/Rockfall

State road 108 (2000 W Clinton) is wide enough to be two lanes each direction at the intersection with State road 37 (1800N Clinton) but is currently painted for just one. The intersection backs up nearly to 800 N in the late afternoon, and just as bad on the north side. Painting a second lame would permit more cars to get through the intersection per light cycle, minimizing the traffic and residing rear end collisions.	Striping

Since moving to east Kaysville 4 years ago the flow of rush hour traffic in the evening has become much less efficient and bogged down, something is causing it to back up and slow consistently since changes were made on the north end of the stretch.  Hwy-89 moves at 20 mph excluding stop lights. This has added 15 minutes every day to what use to be a 20 minute drive. Please look into this, the problem has consistently gotten worse.	Other
I drive hwy 89 daily for over 15 years.  The islands you have on most of 89 need to go away.  They cause slick conditions in the winter and cause traffic congestions when someone is pulling into the very small turning lanes.  They cause more problems then good.  Just make a continuous turning lane like most of 89 already is.	Guardrail

The SB lanes are shifted a few feet left for HOV lane construction.  In the far left lane, there is a lot of uneven pavement and potholes just to the left of the yellow line.  Since the lanes are shifted over, cars are being forced to drive on these rough patches and over the potholes, or hug the middle lane divider to avoid them.  I'm concerned this is going to cause vehicle damage or an accident.  Please repair the pavement along this stretch of theedian since the lanes will be shifted for a while.	Pothole
On 2000 west and sr193, there are too many people not yielding. People making a left turn from 2000 west (southbound) onto 193 will take the turn while there is somebody making a right turn from 2000 west (northbound.) Who should this be addressed to?	Other
the light at 800 w has a pedestrian timer.  I use this daily and have never seen a pedestrian. The light is so long traffic is often backed up to the entrance to the off ramp.

After you exit the freeway going north on exit 282, and you turn left on W 2100 N/highway 85, the stop light lasts for 5 minutes and 30 seconds (I timed it after noticing the issue a few times).

I have seen this happen a few times now.	Traffic Signals

I was just issued a new car, and now I have at least 5 hood dings, and a couple windshield chips!  That was a mess!	Road Debris/Rockfall
This area is a mess generally and I have many suggestions, but it would be great if there was signage to warn people on the south west side of the freeway that they're in a lane that will be forced onto I-15. They always awkwardly merge and cause the through traffic to have to wait through extra lights.	Signage
This intersection is majorly backed up when driving west to east on 85 before you go under the freeway.  The lights metering traffic coming off the freeway appear to stay green for several minutes, while the lights allowing traffic to go underneath the freeway are very short.  Traffic is horrendous!  I would also suggest some type of median that stops traffic from driving up the left lane and then cutting back to the right in the intersection.	Traffic Signals

Traffic is backing up at this intersection b/c the light for northbound & southbound travel is too short in duration. Only 2-3 cars can proceed per light cycle. Also, vehicles in the northbound left lane are attempting to merge into the right lane at the last minute b/c the left lane is only a left hand turn on to the I-15 N on ramp. This is adding to the northbound delays & traffic back ups for vehicles commuting northbound on 2100 N into Lehi. Another contributor is the on ramp for southbound I-15, just be before the signal light. Traffic backs up on SR-85.	Traffic Signals
Southbound on ramp to I15 at Thanksgiving pt. has absolute no signage that the lane is merging into traffic very quickly.

Friday evening, 4:50 PM. I-15 northbound, trying to exit at Lehi 2100 N. It's stormy, visibility is bad. Exiting traffic is backed up several hundred yards on the freeway and there's no unusual construction or accident nearby.

I'm watching and that see SIX CARS can make the left turn per cycle, with #5 being a yellow light and #6 running a definite red.

Ten minutes and many cycles pass and we're finally off the proper freeway but still on the ramp. As the clock rolls over to 5:00:00 pm, the timing instantly changes and now 17-20 cars are able to make the left / westbound turn.

Perhaps the timing group could change adjust the schedule so  the longer intervals begin at 16:45?	Traffic Signals

The southbound light only lets 2-3 cars through during rush hour.	Traffic Signals
This interchange would more efficient if the lights cycled in the opposite order (eastbound 1st, then westbound, then northbound offramp). Currently, westbound traffic turning left onto the southbound on ramp gets stuck in the left turn lane because the eastbound traffic starts moving after the westbound traffic, before they are able to turn left. 

The other thing that would help traffic flow is a "keep clear" and lines indicating to the eastbound traffic that, yes, you really shouldn't block the traffic turning left onto the on ramp when the eastbound traffic gets backed up at the light. Similar lines and words should be painted where the frontage road intersects with 1200 W. There have been many times that vehicles have blocked my ability to turn left there. 

Also, the westbound lights really need to last a little longer; traffic gets backed up to the railroad tracks on 1200 W during rush hour.	Traffic Signals
The off-ramp light cycles several times allowing the cross traffic to go but skipping the off-ramp traffic.  This has caused issues with traffic backing up onto the freeway. A couple times I have sat at the light for 10 to 15 minutes waiting for it to change.  I have also seen cars that have been skipped several times in the rotation go ahead and turn when traffic was clear.   

I have experienced this problem several times over the last few months.  It seems as though perhaps a sensor is not functioning properly as pattern of the instances is not consistent.	Traffic Signals

The evening traffic backs up clear through / north of the intersection with U-73. This is way to much and takes way to long to get through, something needs to be done. Even the back roads (800 West for one) have construction and some were closed Monday evening. Traffic blocks the intersection at highway 73, Pioneer Crossing and 400 North. Pioneer traffic that continues through Redwood west is backed up for miles. Sometimes the intersection is so blocked that no cars move through on several light cycles in a row.	Other

You can barely get one car through the light cycle especially if you are not quite at the lights when they turn green. They should be on for a set time not what appears to be one or two cars at the most. The best time is when the Junior high gets out but they only stay green longer because there is a long line of traffic. I get the impression they are working off the number of cars waiting in line to go. This is really annoying when you are a few tens of feet behind the line and the lights turn back to red. Also, if you get to the lights just as the lights on Canyon Road change to red, you will not get through the lights on this cycle. You have to wait for the next cycle. Please deal with this. It's really annoying. Can't you just have them on a set length?	Traffic Signals
You really need to put a physical lane restriction in at the eastbound junction of Canyon Road and 820 E, Spanish Fork. You have people using the parking lane on that corner as a turning lane to turn right onto 820 E southbound, when it is not. This causes the people in the main line of traffic (me frequently!!), who often are signaling to turn southbound on 820 E to be unaware of the person incorrectly sitting waiting to turn the same direction. I have seen several times where there has nearly been an accident because of this. This corner is a serious accident waiting to happen. Please, put in a physical island to stop these people using that lane to turn right. These lights are meant to help traffic flow, but they are just causing those of us who live round them to find them irritating and inconvenient.	Signage
The tree limbs appear to be blocking the sensor from sensing cars that are south bound on 800 east trying to either turn east onto Canyon Road or continue south onto 820 east. Or maybe the sensor isn't working.	Traffic Signals

Every morning and afternoon there is a line to take kids to school at Spanish Fork Junior High, but because there is no turn signal at the traffic light on Canyon Rd to turn South on 820 E only two cars at most can go during these busy times.

The recent change to turn on the meters to the northbound ramp of 400 S in Springville is creating serious congestion that stretches back for 1/4 - 1/2 miles.  Previously the flow of traffic was smooth as cars entered I-15, but now it adds at a minimum 10 - 15 minutes of additional wait time.  I would encourage UDOT to come and observe the congestion that has been caused  since Monday 9/17 when these meters were turned on.  

I understand the logic behind creating the ramp meters, but it has had an adverse effect.  UDOT should consider making the meter "2 Cars per Green Light' or some other type of change at the minimum to lessen  the congestion that has been created.  Turning off the meters would be the most logical suggestion.	Ramp Meters

I-15 freeway at 14600 South westbound is unsafe. The road is so narrow, and poorly striped, that I have a hard time staying in my lane. I fear hitting barricades on the N side of the street on the big swerve that heads SW. There's a frightening lack of shoulder on the south side of the street. There is a barricade at the light pole so I'm reminded that if I were to hit it, it would be deadly.	Other

On 6/11 I contracted the town to advise that the timing of the light at the bottom of the Circ is causing problems. I was told the work being done by the state would fix that timing.  It didn’t.  Just like last year, the Circ was completely empty for essex residents commuting, while Colchester commuters sat in 10-15 minutes of traffic in the 50 MPH zone before you reach the Circ on Rt 2A. This also causes a backup on Gentes rd as the flow has been restricted. This needs to be addressed as I stated back in June and is a terrible way to treat your neighboring town residents.

Most of the lamp lights on the On Tap side of Park through five corners to the bank are out.  Too many people walking around to have it be dark, especially since all the hot rodders are in town.	Street Light
It is unsafe to close the sidewalk along Park St.  The needs of the contractor working on the adjacent building could be served by by brief closures only for the purpose of immediate safety concerns.   Another option to place traffic barriers and limit the northbound vehicles to on lane.   Pedestrians seem to always receive the lowest priority.	Sidewalk
The center line pavement markings between Franklin Street and 5 Corners on Park Street seems to be non-existent. Most notably is the left turn lane from Park Street to Route 15 Westbound. It is become dangerous as those not from the area don't realize there is a turn lane there and are using it as a oncoming travel lane. Can someone from the village work with the State to get some new paint down on the road surface sooner? I realize this is more than likely part of the improvements underway in that area now, but a minor fix may get us by in the meantime.	Other

Given the number of complaints throughout the years of overgrown vegetation on this chain link fence, can we look into it as a zoning violation. the chain link fence is greater than 3 ft tall, and with the vegetation, you can not see through the fence, sight lines are blocked.

I've witnessed cars in the Southbound left-turn lane go straight through onto Monroe, sometimes competing with cars in the right lane also going straight through onto Monroe. Obviously, this is dangerous. While you can't fix stupid, perhaps it would be better if the left lane was the one for going straight.

Topic: Illegal Removal of Vegetation Buffer bordering Hwy 305 at Intersection of Winslow Way

Over the 18 months there has been a removal of the vegetation buffer on what I assume is public land bordering on Hwy 305 in order to display the Avalara sign on the corner property. The slow and steady encroachment over that time makes obvious that they were aware of their violation of the city statute. 

It is my understanding that the City of Bainbridge has vegetation screen requirements for this type of area.	Code Enforcement Issue

The mower is reaching into the beach grass (not just mowing a narrow strip). There is at least 1 sandpiper nest here and other nests. Birds, including goldfinches, feed and "hang out" here regularly.

Even when the mower is not directly mowing nests, the beach is so narrow here that nests and birds are very close. The protection the grasses provide is lessened. 

This is at least the 3rd time the beach grass has been mowed this season.

Less mowing is needed in this area. It is a sensitive habitat.	Road Issue

Due to the CRT closure for erosion repair, bicycle traffic westbound is diverted off the trail at Riverview Park. Travel is along the sidewalk adjacent to Highway 169. Cyclist must then travel through the Community Center over the footbridge to reconnect with the trail under I405. I am a regular daily all-weather commuter. I travel West before 5am. I have great lights. I was not anticipating the gap in the grate. I am fortunate that I am an experienced cyclist with good equipment that I only sustained some damage to my wheel and bruising on my hands. There is a high likelihood one can experience a permanent brain injury from a wheel entrapment obstacle such as this by being ejected over the handlebars. Please repair soon as traffic will be increasing due to the trail closure. There is another grate on the eastbound direction is the same location with a similar gap.	Park Issue
This request was submitted to the City of Renton directly, prior to being imported into SeeClickFix.	Tree Issue
The traffic lights are not timed on WB 169 at the Sherie’s Intersection, 405 ramp, Sunset Blvd, Park Ave, and 2nd and Main. I’ve been driving this route for years, and I believe this problem was created when you redesigned the intersection at 2nd and Main a couple years ago. If you’re at the light at Sherie’s for example you can only make the next green light at 405 if you’re the first car and you floor it. This is definitely a safety problem, and it creates congestion. Please time the lights on WB 169 coming into Renton. Also the light at 154th and WB 169 also has a problem. Between 2:30pm and 3:00pm it might only let three vehicles through before turning Yellow. I’ve noticed this issue for the last month or so. Please increase the time of the green light. Now that I think about it I do remember seeing a crew out there last Summer. If I had known they were going to shorten the time of the green light I would have said something.	Traffic Signal Issue
This light needs to be fixed. On multiple occasions I have sat at this light for more than 5 minute and there have been some instances where I've been sitting at this light for upwards of 10 minutes. There is no specific time of day this happens and there is no specific day. It happens at any time of any day. Please fix this light!	Streetlight Issue

I cross Bronson Way North at Factory Avenue north daily.

I also want to say that no one seems to sees the No Turn on Red sign on Factory Avenue North and Bronson Way North corner.
I have to stand back when a car approaches because they don't need the sign and there are so many near misses.
I wish they would put a bigger sign there.

As stated in the title, homeless drug addicts prostitutes and criminals hang out at the park 24/7 drink, do drugs, scream fight and yell all day and night. Police do nothing about it despite the numerous calls from myself and others from apartment complexes around the park. They break into vehicles, laundry rooms, knock and kick on people's doors in the middle of the night, sleep in hallways and elevators terrorizing the neighborhood. Police drive by occasionally talk to them and do nothing (most of the time don't even stop) they go back to doing what they do which includes attacking citizens (took the police 1hr to show up the other day on report of assault), braking the glass at the bus stop on 144th right next to the park NUMEROUS times, called police they never showed up. They're very well aware of the situation that is happening here yet are doing ZERO about it. Waste of tax dollars! I don't know what it's going to take for this problem to be resolved, people living around this park do not sleep because of this very serious issue. City of tukwila tore down the motels and released all these drug addicts and criminals out on the streets for regular people do deal with them with no help from the police or the city whatsoever. A simple Google search will confirm things I've said about this park and this issue. This place needs to be torn down immediately.

I'm having an issue with this intersection per say.  I ask last year about this and the county painted a solid line so that people wouldn't turn into the lane to go to the post office.  Well lately lots aren't paying attention to that.  

My issue is that when you turn left onto Silverdale Way using the left lane and then you drive a short distance to turn into the post office.  People just drive on that lane early. I have been and witness close accidents of people crossing the solid line before there time to turn or driving in to early.

Have have attached a photo of what the state did to stop people parking on the right side of Trigger Avenue  coming to get on the freeway because the cars were blocking the view for people turning left onto trigger from the freeway.

Please take a look at this.  Thank you for you time. I know it is the Holidays.	Traffic Safety

I know this is not an issue for the majority of the citizens, but as the weather grows colder it is very important that the handicap spaces remain accessible to those that the spaces are intended for. They are not intended for the youth of Milwaukee to have a quick parking space Just this week I went to the olive garden to pick up food for my Disabled spouse and I parked in the proper take out spot. As I was walking in i had noticed that all the spots in the handicap area were filled with cars without the proper handicap identification.2 of the cars that parked there pulled in at the time i was walking in. One car even parked in the lined out space which is there to provide more space for a van. The individuals waled in to order to go orders. When I asked them about the spots they were in i was told to mind my own business. Please help keeping the spots free. thank you	Other

The pavement condition of Runway Drive between Prince Road and Gardner Lane is horrible.  It is full of potholes and poorly made patches.  It is so rough that heavy vehicles travel at half of the posted speed to keep their doors from literally falling off.  This is a safety concern as passenger vehicles pass them all the time.  Please program a mill and replace for this roadway before ADOT starts the Ruthrauff Interchange as it will undoubtedly see much more traffic once that starts.

I honestly don't know how responsible City staff drive by this repeatedly and don't do something about it?  Really.

If I was on the Mayor's staff, I would call in the Department Head responsible for this and make it clear that this lack of professionalism undermines support for our City Government.

This is associated with the drainage issue on this section of E. Calle Ensenada.	Pothole
The local streets in the El Montivideo are very awful, but this is one of two areas in the neighborhood, where there is a major drainage/flooding issue (the other being Calle De Soto).  This is resulting in cracking of the asphalt due to undermining of the street and street associated with the weight of the water.  A mosquito issue also is evident during the warmer months.  This can be corrected with some simple regarding within the right of way and repair of pot holes.	Pothole
Another pothole in front of the house at 3802 E. Calle Ensenada.  The street is bad enough that running in the morning before dawn is a major risk taking event.  I look forward to the City addressing this issue.  Thanks.	Pothole

Description
Reporting again as it has been months trying to get this issue addressed. 
Broadmoor neighborhood. Arroyo Chico entry/exit to S Tucson Blvd. Both streets straddling the arroyo. Weeds, ground vegetation, on top of the arroyo and trees in the arroyo (east side of street underpass) are obstructing visibility to drivers entering exiting the Broadmoor neighborhood. Trees need to be removed, not just cut back, and vegetation on top of arroyo needs to be removed, not just cut back, at least 20 feet back from Tucson Blvd. This has been reported numerous times in the past months and nothing has been done. The inability to see through this vegetation is going to cause and accident. The problem is getting worse as trees grow and weeds, ground vegetation bloom (desert broom) and leaf out. Please address this problem soon.

Hello,

There is a very large towable camping trailer parked directly in front of my gate blocking visibility for other motorists turning into west ridge Tucana. It's creating a hazard for school children at the school bus stop located in Westridge and Tucana street and a hazard for motorists while exiting/entering the house gate. 

I will upload a picture during school pickup tomorrow but I am sending it to your attention.

Richland Heights West is bound by Campbell, Ft. Lowell, Mountain and Prince. It is a 4 block by 4 block rectangle. We have dirt streets (in the middle of the city). They need periodic maintenance, i.e., grading.
 
Our streets have not been graded or maintained or graded in quite some time. Right now there are very large pits and holes throughout the neighborhood that make the streets very bumpy and hard on the cars, trucks, buses and ambulances that drive on them. There is quite a bit of school traffic to Holoway Elementary School on Martin and Kleindale.
 
Could you ask Tucson street maintenance to come out, look at the condition of our streets and possibly grade them? We only do this every few years but it is time once again. It usually takes several months to do a study, schedule the maintenance and actually do the work but it would be good if we could get something done before the monsoons this summer.	Pothole

Ok, Tucson water had a leaky valve nearby to a pothole. They come fix the leak but leave a mess of a pavement patch with dirt on the road and do nothing about the pothole. It would be great to have city departments actually work together. So please fix the pothole and the bad patch job. Thanks	Pothole
Cactus Blvd, north of Allen Road, which is heavily traveled by people walking, biking, pushing strollers and walking dogs, is a perpetual mess. Potholes over previously-filled potholes, edges crumbling away, etc. - all on the way to the entrances of Rio Vista Park. Would be nice to see that very small stretch re-done, with a pedestrian path that would keep folks out of the street and dusty dirt. I keep hoping - and reporting what I see...	Pothole
With the recent rains, several large potholes have become bigger by the entrance to Rio Vista Park on Cactus Blvd. The edges of the pavement are worn away in several areas too, the entire length of the street, on both sides. 
Please fill with asphalt, not that other stuff that just washes away in the next rain.
It sure would be nice to have an asphalt pedestrian path installed on the east side of the road!	Pothole
When trying to make a left turn on to Tucson Boulevard south, from Allen Road, there is a bush that is completely blocking the view of North bound Tucson Boulevard traffic.

On N. Cactus Blvd, starting at the traffic circle at E. Allen Road and going north, there are 38 potholes. Also, the pavement is washed away in a lot of areas, and there are bushes that are growing into the roadway. A lot of people walk along there every day, with dogs and strollers. There are no sidewalks. Interestingly, where the sidewalk begins, the road is in much better shape.	Pothole

The issue is the residents in a fourplex of the neighborhood refuse to use ALL 3 of their trash bins and choose to overpile the 1 that is closest to the driveway. By wind or when people pile more trash and other trash falls out and is left; there is trash all over the street and blowing into yards. This happens every single week and is very frustrating. The overpiling trash is the view we have as soon as you turn onto Bermuda and the stench come the weekend  (pickup is Monday) is absolutely disgusting. I have called code enforcement several times, and the water/trash company and nothing has improved. The situation is escalating and I am not sure what to do anymore.	Litter
Same issue, new week. Trash bags are on the floor around empty bins along with mattress set, boxes, loose trash. Code Enforcement has been called -nothing done. City of Tucson called -nothing done. Crazy that this is a residential street in the City of Tucson and no one cares! Maybe if it were in Sam Hughes neighborhood something would have been done but not in DodgeFlower. There are good people that live here and care about the neighborhood and try to work with officials but receive zero support. How do we keep ALL of Tucson clean and beautiful if we have residential properties that are continually in violation but are not reprimanded??	Litter

Same issue different week. The trash containers for this complex are located on Bermuda Street, a residential street. However, the residents at this complex abuse the trash containers. They leave the containers overfilled with loose trash to spill into the street, dump their unused furniture (see mattresses for the 2nd week in a row, and the bins are used as a dumpsite for a landscaping business, and anyone else who drives up ( see mini containers now left too). I have contacted code enforcement 4 weeks straight-NOTHING DONE! I've contacted the city, who I believe had last week's mattresses removed, but as you can see nothing was done to keep the residents to continue to treat the neighborhood street as their personal dump!! The city needs to enforce an area inside the complex to keep their trash since the complex can't learn to properly throw out their trash per the city of Tucson's rules and regulations!!!	Litter

Westbound Speedway @ 2nd Ave	Pothole
Drove down Speedway today and noticed that just a block west from the other one I reported at 3rd Ave, there is another section of pavement that should be painted....Right now there are just signs with arrows indicating pedestrian crossings...I have a feeling that this is the design now and that the crosswalks are purposely not painted or going to be in the future.  However, in my opinion, it is difficult to see these "designated pedestrian crossings" and the roadway should be painted for improved visibility and safety...if a little paint can save a life and any money associated from potential lawsuits from the crossing not being painted, I think it is worth it...Thanks.

Tractor tire directly accross from Tidewater Boating Center	Illegal Dumping
There is a speed bump here at the Tidewater boating center, which is either on the Bay Trail, or on a connector used by many bicycles to get on it. This speedbump is short and severe, in the shadow of a tree, and its paint is completely worn off. I hit it without seeing it, and almost fell off my bike in a way that would like have caused me to break an arm, wrist, or my skull. I barely managed to hang onto my handlebars.  I spoke to an East Bay parks employee here who said that she has seen three people crash there on bicycles and has had to administer first aid to some of them. This is an immediate and urgent issue to have this repainted to avoid injury to bicyclists. It also, longer-term, should be made into a longer broader speedbump so that if a bicyclist doesn't see it they don't wreck.	Streets - Street Deterioration

There are two vehicles that are parked  on the street between East 23rd street and East 22nd on 11th Avenue. These two cars are there for weeks and is becoming a nuisance. They are not moved and both of these vehicles seems to have no ownership because they do not have California license plates. One vehicle is early model Honda Accord 4 door sedan. It is dark blue color.  It has parking tickets attached to the windshield. It has several dents and one of the window is left opened. The other vehicle is a tan gold color early model Jaguar 4 door sedan. This vehicle has been sitting here for weeks. It is hogging the parking space. It is a eye sore to see this vehicle here. The owner or owners seems to neglect the vehicle to leave it on the street for weeks. Again, these vehicles have no license plates. I would like to see them get towed away. I have been trying to find the owners but no luck. I would like to see parking enforcement take care of this issue  as soon as possible. My neighbors are also disappointed in this matter. We may advance this matter to city hall if there is no action by the end of this month of May 2018.	Parking - Enforcement

Blight. New items dumped everyday, primarily on sidelot. But also out front and in front of doors on shattuck and 57th. I've reported this issue before and it was closed without he items being cleaned up. Hazardous materials are starting to pile up- including broken cfl lights (mercury) and paint cans. I know you can't pick up on private property, but  what if the items were moved to the sidewalk? This site has a blight complaint but nothing is being done. The door keeps being broken into as well. Want to prevent a crackden from starting. This situation needs to be taken care of.	Illegal Dumping

I am a bike commuter.  I pass by the Lake Merritt Bart on 8th Street on a regular basis.  While in the bike lane yesterday morning (Monday, 8/28, 8:15 am), I was doored by a driver dropping off a passenger who was going into the Bart station. 

Drivers dropping off passengers on 8th Street at the Oak Street intersection is a danger to bikers.  If I am in the bike lane, I face dangers from opening doors.  If I ride to the left of cars, I can easily be in the line of drivers who pull off from the station to merge back into traffic.  I suggest a protected bike lane be established on 8th Street,  .

There is a dog that barks almost every single night starting around 9:30PM or so and will bark off and on for an hour or more. It's located in the building behind ours and I can't locate the exact unit but it looks like a small apartment complex that's green in color. Animal control's online form requires an exact address. We're on Ivy and that building is on Park.  The dog can be heard quite clearly by multiple people in our building It makes it hard to sleep and is constantly waking our children. Can animal control please send someone out to check on this? I guarantee if they come by around 9:30pm they'll hear it! Help!	Other: Other City Services

It is Saturday, September 22nd, 2018, 10:00 PM. The Oakland Coliseum is blasting loud amplified music and setting off extremely loud fireworks that can be heard as far away as the south shore of Alameda. Residents of Alameda are being exposed to high decibel noise that is so loud it can be heard miles away late at night while they are trying to sleep. This is a violation of Alameda County Ordinance 6.60.050 and California Civil Code section 1941.1 and California Health and Safety Code sections 17920.3 and 17920.10. Multiple noise complaints filed with Alameda Police, Oakland Police and voicemails left on Coliseum voicemail system (they never answer their phones, even during their advertised business hours.) This is not the first time they've done this. There was a news story in a bay area newspaper a few years ago documenting over 1,500 noise complaints received from residents of various bay area cities about the noise at the coliseum. This is not the first and probably not the last time they've done this. They are creating a massive nuisance to bay area residents across the east bay and must be held accountable. Please cite the Oakland Coliseum for violating county ordinance and state law, disturbing the peace at late hours at night	Other City Services
Twice within the past month, I've tried to turn left from fifth Avenue onto the Embarcadeo, only to find a car facing me head on. This construction is kind of a mess. Because the old street paint looks like the new street paint when there's a glare. You literally cannot tell what lines are old and new. Trucks are confused, bikers are confused… this construction needs to be moved forward.  The street narrowing for construction is a bad situation. Please hurry up and fix this section of the Embarcadero so the road can be opened up properly. That means regaining a turn lane and a bike lane. Thank you! Ps: you can see in that photo where the word STOP is painted on the ground… That's where I almost had the two head on collisions. Traffic now goes the opposite way there!

The coliseum violated city noise ordinances by setting off a huge fireworks display that ended at midnight, Aug 16th 2019. They are excessively loud and disturbing to thousands of neighbors!

Rosas Brothers worked on Creed Road and Trestle Glen Road repaving and replacing sidewalk.  They placed "No Parking" saw horses which limited parking from 11/5/19 - 11/15/19.  Those saw horses and orange cones, as well as, a huge orange "Road Work Ahead" sign remain cluttering our streets - Trestle Glen and Creed Roads.   The work has been completed.  I telephoned Rosas Brothers (510-534-1077), two days ago to report the problem.  Nothing has happened.  The items remain cluttering our neighborhood.  It seems to me that Rosas Brothers is using our streets and our sidewalks to store their signs and cones.  Please have the items removed.  Gratefully, Sandra Costa	Other City Services

There are potholes of all sizes all along Canning Street between 58th and 62nd. These are especially bad between 59th and McAuley on Canning. They are large, filled with rocks and rain and dangerous! The entire street needs to be surveyed and fixed. It's a nightmare trying to bike around here-let alone drive. I see that this entire area is neglected and what has been fixed from the past is worn out, displaced, unlevel and in disrepair. The majority have increased sizably this fall and winter and only get worse. I'm not sure why I can only enter one photo-there are too many potholes and torn up areas of the street to mention.

Non intended park visitors recently:  enclosed area of the park is intended for toddlers through elementary kids. Recently there have been groups of older kids who use rough language, hoard the park equipment and smoke. Can anything be done about this?	Park Issue
Please install lights at Temescal Creek Park. Although the park is open until 9pm, the sun sets so early in the wintertime that the park is unusable in the early evenings. During the summer, the park is usually busy between 5 and 8 p.m., but between November and March, park users who work until 5 p.m. are unable to enjoy the park with their friends, children, and dogs after work. A few lights near the playground, basketball court, and dog run would make Temescal Creek Park safer and more accessible for everyone.	Park Issue

The Stop sign coming down the hill on B'way Terrace is consistently ignored by drivers making that intersection a dangerous corner.

at the very end of Jean St by 580 freeway.  There is a storm drain, which I have kept clear of debris, however, on the opposite side of the chain link fence (and the storm drain grate) that separates Jean Street from the slope leading down to the freeway the cement drain is full of debris.  Some left by Mother Nature (leaves, Ivy, etc) and some left by humans who have tossed it over the fence.  This storm drain starts at Chetwood  and continues down past Crescent St. and empties out at the end of Santa Clara where the on ramp to 580 is.  With all the rain we've had and the rain yet to come the ability for the storm drains to handle the water coming from the streets is certainly limited.  Note:  There is an entrance gate at the end of Jean street so one can gain access to this area but it has a large link chain on it and a padlock so you will have to find whoever has the key or bring something to cut the lock off with.

Yesterday and today there was more dumping=plastic garbage bags, pieces of granite counter tops, pvc pipes, misc tubing, drawers from kitchen perhaps, parts of vacuum cleaner and lots of little stuff.  Looks like debris left over from possible kitchen make over, not sure.  The above larger pieces of wood maybe from the same makeover?

What it Oakland's plan for enforcement of the new BRT Bus lanes along International Blvd.  There is a very dangerous situation now where Left Turn Only lanes have been set up, crossing over the BRT lanes.  There is ZERO enforcement of the BRT lanes so cars are currently using it as an express lane (60MPH+) to get around slower traffic in the single lane roadway, completely ignoring the red red light arrow above the lane. This means that someone using the Left Turn lane is literally risking their life to make a left turn (especially on a motorcycle).  Something needs to be done IMMEDIATELY before someone dies along this stretch of roadway!	Street Light (Not Traffic Signal) - Outage/Damaged

Hi.  Not sure if this is the correct place to voice a complaint. The city is currently working on my street and today left a metal plate over the hole they are working on. Every time a car drives over it, it makes a very loud sound. It’s so loud that it’s causing my household sleeping issues as our bedrooms are on the street and it has woken us up. I u nderstand that this is a temporary situation but am hoping it can be fixed asap so we don’t have more sleepless nights! Thank you!	Streets/Sidewalks - Curb & Gutter Repair

The pothole/decaying pavement that was just repaired at the corner of Pinehaven and Broadway Terrace has already, in just a few days, started to sink again, making it once more a thing to be avoided, because of the potential damage to front-end alignment and tires.  Folks, big buses go over that spot, so the fix needs to be more substantial than just a few shovelsful of asphalt.  Thanks for trying, and please, give it a better fix soon.  Avoiding that by going into the downhill lane on a blind curve is very risky/dangerous.	Pothole

Hello,

There is a gaping pothole near the pedestrian walkway on Grand Avenue near the Old Brooklyn Cafe. It's starting to resemble a trench. It's situated right on the part of the street where most bicyclists would cycle over. I near lost control of my bike going over it, and I think the hole has only gotten worst since I ran over it. 

I hope you can fix this soon. It's a real hazard, and someone will inevitably get hurt here.

Thank you,

I own and live at 341 Vernon St. in Oakland. When we moved in around 2001 almost no puddle formed in front of our house when it rained and there was not puddle in front of the driveway as seen in the photo. There was a minor increase of the puddle over the years but that might have been caused by the tree seen in the photo growing. 

Since the rains started this season something has changed and some kind of sinkhole is forming. The sidewalk has buckled up about two inches (wish I could upload more photos to show that clearly) with one inch of movement over the last few weeks. Part of the walk to our house near sidewalk is also cracking and sinking. Under one flagstone I have filled a hole with at least a few cubic feet of dirt in the past.

Someone should come out right way as there is a big trip hazard and some kind of problem underground with the land sinking so fast. My waterline from the street is right in the middle of the depression and is starting to get stressed. I imagine it will break at some point.	Streets - Potholes/Depression

There is a big sewer spill destabilizing a very steep hillside above the common driveway of 2160 and 2250 Mastlands, Oakland CA 94611.  

Part of a sewer pipe that used to be underground is now visible and there is a fresh deep and fairly large sewage/mudslide that has significantly altered the shape of this very steep hillside.

The location is difficult to describe so feel free to call me at (415) 254-0838 if you need a verbal description.  You have to climb 50 feet up from the top of the common driveway to get to it.

The leakage starts a couple of feet above a small size manhole which itself, is several feet north of a full size raised manhole.  Both these manholes determine the property line between 5956 Ascot Drive (east) and 2250/2160 Mastlands (west).

I would like to see some signage -- at least a YIELD sign -- at the top of High where it intersects with Tompkins, warning drivers making a left onto Tompkins that traffic coming from the right does not stop. Currently there is nothing. People drive pretty fast along Tompkins from Carlson to High, and visibility is not good because of the planted median.  For anyone unfamiliar with how the intersection works, it's quite dangerous; since High is the greater thoroughfare, when drivers reach the High-Tompkins' T they assume they have the right-of-way.

The 2 street lights at the NE corner of Seminary and International, kitty corner from Los Dos Gallos restaurant, are out again. Could it be that the light-sensing set up, that I imagine is what enables the lights to automatically come on and go off, is not properly set? I'm wondering if the ambient light from traffic and street and signal lights from other corners are causing these lights to either not come on at all or go off while it's still dark. I have not seen this corner in the evening, only in the early mornings. Can something be done so they are consistently on when it's dark? I've only seen them on one morning, right after I last reported the issue.	Street Light (Not Traffic Signal) - Outage/Damaged

Late at night people are going into the ravine on Oak Hill Road close to where it intersects with Sequoyah Road. I have seen drug usage on the road there, but cannot see what else is going on inside the area. People are going into the ravine at odd hours in complete darkness, from 10:30 PM onwards. The land there is steep, so it's also not conducive for road pit stops, amorous couples and the like. What could be going on there? I strongly feel that the unlit, unmonitored area is a security risk for our neighborhood.	Other: Other City Services

The street is crumbling and causing large holes (larger than an ordinary pothole) all along the street.  This kicks up lots of gravel as cars drive by (since the street is crumbling into pieces).  After the rains this month, there was a lot of standing water pooling in the holes (again, these holes are large; some are 5-10 feet long) and consequently a lot of mosquitoes.  I'm not sure if the holes need to be filled or the street repaved.  Either way, it is a mess to keep clean, it is dangerous because there is debris kicked up by passing cars (kids have been hit in the face with flying rocks), and the excess water sitting in these pools is unhealthy.  Thank you for your time.	Street/Traffic Issue (Other than Pothole)

Yesterday, the pothole area flooded with water because of an unrelated water issue. The picture shows what happens when it rains. The last paving job made a paving block in the gutter where the water flows down the street to the drain. Water pools at the pothole because of the pavement flaw.  This is contributing to the increased deterioration of the pavement around the pothole.	Streets - Potholes/Depression

My family has lived at 2511 Chelsea Drive, Oakland 94611, since 1986. In that 31 year span, Chelsea Drive has not been repaved or repaired. It is in deplorable condition, especially the area on this side of Chelton Drive.

I was under the impression that there is now an Oakland Department of Transportation that has a fund of $3,000,000 or so to fix the potholes and do some much-needed repaving. I would like you to add my street to the list and please let me know when I and my neighbors can expect this long-overdue repaving to take place.	Streets - Street Deterioration

An Oakland parking enforcement vehicle was on Webster right in front of me, flashing lights on, with the illegally parked vehicles in plain view ahead, but then just turned right on 22nd and drove away with no tickets written. What the heck is going on?! Double parking on Webster St is rampant from 22nd Street all the way south to 7th Street, often blocking the bike lane and causing serious safety and congestion issues. Please write some tickets! At the very least any delivery vehicles should park at the far left blocking one of the 2-3 car lanes, instead of on the right blocking the only bike lane and half of another travel lane.

This property is a blight and a fire hazard. It has a been a construction time with long lapses of time between work being done. The grass is dry and wildly overgrown. There are building supplies including insulation that litter the property. With all of the concern about fire safety, how can the city not address these issues with the owner of this property. The neighborhood is tired of looking at an unsafe, blighted property. Please do something to address this situation which threatens the safety of the neighborhood, especially in this hot, dry season.

Hello, I had already reported this to city of San Diego but they replied that it is outside their service area. 
Illegal dumping was done on the fire access road right behind Aquatica. There are sinks and toilets and mattresses that were dumped. The fire access road is accessible at three points. 1. The gate directly south from the entrance to Aquatica. 2. From "Avenida De Las Vistas" further down past "Vista San Javier" (this gate is broken off its hinge). 3. From "Topsoil Drive".

Twice in the past few days, the traffic signal at East H and Eastlake Drive has made westbound drivers wait a considerable time, for non-existent cars to turn left (from eastbound East H, northward onto Eastlake Drive).  The light stays red for westbound drivers significantly longer than the time that a couple of cars turning left from westbound H, southward onto Eastlake drive toward the lake, get a green arrow.  So the signal is "detecting" a long line of "phantom" cars, not just one or two.	Traffic Signal (Timing)

They also tagged a concrete block fence with black spray paint. It would help for police to increase patrol units in the alley lane to curb tagging activity at night and at dawn.

There are two 50ft-60ft pine trees located on the slope, between my backyard fence and a heavily used walking  trail.  One of the trees is almost completely dead, and the other looks like it's also dying.  There is also a tree (type unknown) that have suffered broken branches from our last strong gust of wind.  The trail, where these trees are located is heavily used by dog-walkers and joggers.  It is regularly maintained by the city.  However, I am concerned that these trees have become a fire hazard to my property, along with my neighbors' properties.  It could also become a big liability for the city, if they should fall on anyone.	Trees

There are so many dog feces along the trail of Rice Canyon. You can’t enjoy your run or walk because you have to constantly look down to avoid stepping on it. There’s a small sign about cleanup in the beginning of the trail but will it be helpful if the sign is bigger and if the fine violation is posted? Maybe have a plastic bag receptacle? Are there cleaners/maintenance in charge of implementing the fines and cleaning up feces?

About a month ago in front of the Castle Arms apartments, on 250 Quintard Street, work was carried out on the public driveway and it was covered with asphalt, which, as the days went by, the material was deformed and a surface sunk in one part and bulked in another. That is. Now we have a pothole and a bump, and all the vehicles that pass by there have to suffer the impact on their four wheels and the suspension. I suppose the badly resurfaced street has a warranty. It is urgent that it be repaired because no motorist wants their car to be damaged because of that bad work. Thank you for your attention and prompt solution to the problem.

The SW corner of the intersection of Stone Gate and Hawthorne Creek streets is a very popular site for parents to pick up children from Eastlake Middle School. The kids often purchase snacks from a mobile vendor while waiting for their rides. There is no place to discard the resulting waste, so it ends up on the ground. From the ground, the trash subsequently blows into the canyon or into the yards of the residences on Hawthorne Creek.  It is truly an eyesore on an off-used walking path.

On 6/6/2014 at 11:02am, I was walking in the crosswalk on 8th and Clement when I was honked several times by a traffic officer. As I crossed the street I looked back at the traffic officer who was now trying to park in the red zone in front of a fire hydrant.  I approached the officer and asked why he had honked at me and he replied very rudely "I was in his way and that he didn't have time to talk to me". I asked for his name and badge number.  He refused to give his name or allow me to see his badge. I began to take pictures of his vehicle parked blocking the fire hydrant and he later yelled his badge number of #270. I believe his actions warrant disciplinary actions. Please feel free to contact me regarding this matter. Thank you.  Vehicle plate number  #1028709	Park Requests

I have lived here several months as a tenant. We are not allowed to possess any self-defense items like guns or other intentional weapons. There have been several nights when someone has knocked on my door and hidden but I have been able to view it was a male and that the direct response to my inquiry the first time was denied; and the second time, I did not respond to the knocking. The premises here are not safe (these have been late evening after 10 pm unwelcome knocking). Anyone without an access code can be present since there is no monitoring (only a concierge that often is not present at the front). There should be cameras situated on the floors for safety. Or we should have access to a number for the concierge to confirm any unwelcome visitors.	Housing Conditions

Please fix main streets horrible potholes! These are located in the north end and south end, for some odd reason downtown main street has perfect roads with minimal potholes and its like the city doesn't care about the north and south ends road conditions, maybe because people mainly work there and visit downtowns attractions? This isn't fair to the north and south end residents! There isn't any exact addresses because its the whole part of both ends. They have only been filled with tar making the roads more uneven and bumpy with tiny rocks flying up hitting your car as you pass over the filled holes! I've had my car in for repairs because of this issue and ended up cracking my motor resulting in having to buy a new car among other repairs such as alignments, cracked oil pan and my windshield even cracked from impact. Please assess these two areas carefully and ppave, not just fill the holes!	Pothole

While Downtown gets a promenade that nobody asked for and a stadium to line the pockets of the wealthy, those who walk along Park Street are still risking twisted ankles or worse because of the poor workmanship combined with lack of maintenance.

Short term: we need property owners (church is considered public since they don't pay taxes) and KNOX to get out there and remove the spray paint markings in this neighborhood with the speed one would expect if these were in Downtown. We could also use more patrols, not so much for the graffiti, but because there has been all-around more undesirable activity in the neighborhood in the last few months. 

Long Term: Create some murals in spots that are frequently tagged. Offer some street art workshops at Pope Park Rec Center and/or library. <-- Maybe this is something SAMA could step up to offer. We could also get our electrical boxes painted fancy like they did along Franklin Avenue.	Graffiti

The setting for the red light at Forest for drivers to turn on to Bedford is too long - it's 75 seconds, and when it turns green it's only 30 seconds.  This leads to traffic buildups in the morning rush hour - it sometimes takes almost 5 minutes to get through.  It's not necessary, as the traffic is not that heavy on Bedford.	Other

I am writing on behalf of Tile America at 105 Hamilton Street.  We have an ongoing trash issue that we have been able to catch on camera and would like this to be rectified.  We cannot have this continue as it constantly is blowing trash all over our property. 

We have been noticing piles of trash being dumped at the end of Wallace Street.  The trash piles up, and then is blowing around.  We were able to catch the below on our security camera:

Sundays: after sundown, trash is dumped by a truck 
Mondays: trash sits there 
Tuesdays: the trash is picked up by a bulldozer and then dumped onto a large dumpster on a truck bed.  Trucks are either unmarked or we can't see it from the video camera.

Hello, I've been a new resident in downtown Hartford since September 2016 and I feel there is very little flexibility or appreciation for residents in the area. It seems like there are more young people moving into the area and I think it's important for the City of Hartford to be accommodating and helpful. One thing I think is important is the issue of parking. It seems like the areas around the XL center are always blocked off or have no parking signs. The events seem to prevent residents from parking near the apartment buildings they live in. Another incident this weekend was when I parked next to the G Fox Building, the day before an event was going on. The valet service takes up the whole street and makes it uncomfortable to walk past. Because my car was parked on that specific street the valet service called the police, who came to my apartment, banging on my door, asking me to move the car, which I did immediately. I felt as a resident very inconvenienced and undervalued. I think the main point I want to talk about is the consideration of residents and our value we bring to the city because there are more of us moving in.	General Bus Request/Incident

Owner repeatedly ignores the City directive to clear sidewalks within 24 hours after snowfall. The City replaced the sidewalks of this residence this past fall so now there is no excuse for not shoveling. Townsend Ave is very narrow at this point and walking in the street is a dangerous option especially with a child or pet in tow. Thank you	SNOW RELATED
#247 repeatedly hires someone to shovel a path to her door so she can receive mail but leaves the sidewalks covered in snow where it quickly turns to ice. She did shovel after the last storm when LCI acknowledged the issue. I believe they must have given her a warning because this is the first time in two years her sidewalk has been shoveled. I think she needs a follow-up reminder that the walk must be cleared after every storm. #249 sometimes does the same thing and clears only a pathway to the door. Townsend is very narrow at this point and cars/buses/trucks speed by making it very dangerous to walk in the street.
And for all the trolls who wish to respond to this SCF issue, I already hand shovel the sidewalks and front paths for two older neighbors and that's the best I can do. You, however, are welcome to shovel out these offenders .	Other

Hi. Recently new gas lines were installed on this street. When done, nobody ever came to clean up the mess so the street is very dusty and dirty with small rocks and pebbles everywhere as well as nails and screws too. I have already gotten 5 nails in my tires that ive had to pay to fix. Also on windy days there is a lot of dust blowing around. Can we please schedule a day to close the entire street for parking so that a street cleaner machine can come through and get rid of all this? Thank you.	Street Maintenance

Long Wharf is absolutely disgusting.  I would be embarrassed to advertise it as a ‘paradise’.  The loud music, speeding, illegal parking and the trash are ruining a beautiful part of our city. These are pictures I took this morning.  The trash cans were empty but there was still trash all over (especially styrofoam containers).  And the dumpsters near the food trucks...overflowing.  I could imagine the rats that must run around there.  

Sadly, there is also trash floating in the harbor (the same styrofoam containers, drink bottles, etc.) and I saw a dead bird commorant floating in the water yesterday.  Today a bird was trying to eat a straw.  

Something needs to be done!!	Parks Request
I walk the Long Wharf Promenade/Nature Preserve almost every day.  The litter is out of control. I was curious if anyone from the City orthe Land Trust is responsible for cleaning.  I really think the City needs to provide more trash receptacles, although I really don't think that will help.  Police need to monitor for littering fines when they can.  Can the  food trucks be held responsible for cleaning up the mess that blows into the land areas around the sound from their customers.  It is disgusting and an eyesore. It starts around Lenny & Joes and goes all the way down to the Veterans Memorial.  YOu cannot see it from the road as most of it gets trapped in the rock ledge and seagrass.  Empty booze bottles, broken glass, dirty diapers, makeshift homeless people sleeping areas in the seagrass out of crushed cardboard, oodles of paper plates, stryofoam to-go containers, plastic bags from the taco trucks.  There needs to be more, easy-to-access, lidless trash receptacles placed around the parking areas to promote tossing garbage--ALL of the parking areas from the pier down to the Veterans Memorial.  DEEP should be involved as this is not healthy for the Sound or the storm drains.  I have several pictures I can share, but am only able to upload one.	Illegal Dumping
I thought this issue had been resolved. We are still hearing every weekend the loud,  amplified music coming from Long Wharf.  I know the welcome center has been roped off...that was where the initial music was coming from.	Other
In Long Wharf Park -the home of the soon to be reopened visitors center - the parking lot surface and the general appearance of the area is despicable.  The lot surface is pot holed with some able to swallow a tire whole.  The trash in the park and adjacent areas will certainly fill a small dumpster.  Parks and Trees have signs showing it is their responsibility --- BUT they certainly don't accept any in maintaining and cleaning the area.  What a great introduction to New Haven when the center reopens.	Parks Request

It has been noted that every time there is heavy rain in the Cove Road/Van Buskirk  area of town.  The whole street floods along with my front yard, garbage and basement.  There is at least 3 catch basins . But for some reason the one in front of my home gets does not drain / floods into my property.  For the past week it flooded twice.  I recently had my lawn power seeded twice and twice the seeds were washed away along with my lawn soil  because the catch basin was not working.  There is a orange and white coned by the basin covering obviously a large pot hole. When is this problem going to be fixed?  A call to sewer emergency last night and the catch basin was draining.  No debris clogged this basin.  So I feel that the catch basin was shut off and caused the flooding.	Other

I am writing to report activity at 22 Marshall Street that may not have permits for alterations to the existing structure; and, my be in violation of refusal by the City of Hartford to allow the structure to be utilized as a "rooming house" .

I have witnessed workman for the past two weeks working at the location --- building what would appear to be new internal walls within the structure (22 Marshall Street). Materials have included dry wall, a variety of lumber, table saw, hammering, etc.

Several of my neighbors and I testified before a City of Hartford Committee regarding a petition to make 22 Marshall Street a "rooming house".

The petition was denied by the City of Hartford due to problems within the neighborhood (prostitution, drugs, murders, public urination, vagrants, etc.). 

However, during the hearing, the proponents suggested they might defy the committee's ruling.

What has been occurring (internal alterations to the building) of the past two weeks may, in fact, be the proponents attempts to secretly defy the committee's ruling.  

Lastly, I did walk by 22 Marshal Street and no permits were displayed .

It is my hope that someone from the City of Hartford will visit the location to determine what is occurring.	Zoning

There was a new roof, painting, and chimney replacement done at this property in the past few weeks but no Permits taken out and more importantly no review performed by the Historical Dept. before any work was done.  The paint colors are horrendous and hideous, the color of the roof would not have been approved had it been submitted.  The purpose of the Historical Dept. is to insure that historic properties and neighborhoods maintain continuity and not changed any old way as this property is/was.  In addition, the iron fence is 7 feet high which is not acceptable in a residential zone.  The horrible colors of the house are not in keeping with historical standards and should be put before the Historical Dept. so they are made to look like they belong to a Victorian house, such as is the case on Columbia Street and others.  When homeowners do this it destroys neighborhoods.	Zoning

Last week the DOT undertook a massive clearcutting of mature trees that previously screened I-91 and the entrance and exit ramps in the Wooster Square area. 
What were once embankments with trees blocking both the sites and sounds of the highways for the residences south and north of Wooster Square are now naked hills.

Needless to say this has drastically decreased the quality of life of those living near the highway. 

Without the trees, the noise level has increase to the point where residents previously happy living near the highways are now having to wear earplugs to sleep.

While this might be necessary for the interchange reconstruction underway, this has had a significant and negative impact on Wooster Square and its residences.  

I hope that the DOT realizes just how big an impact this has, and has plans to address this as construction continues, because right now it's a disaster.	Other

High speed traffic through a residential neighborhood is a HUGE concern in Imperial Point and has been for many years. Something MUST be done. Recently they painted multiple 30mph signs on 62nd street as a measure to slow down traffic... REALLY ? What a waste of taxpayer money. No one abides by the 30MPH speed limit (including city busses, semi trucks , law enforcement and many others) I understand that speed humps have been a talking point and have not been approved  because 62nd Street is a main artery to US1, but it's ridiculous. The only thing that has tried to slow the traffic down is an occasional bike cop(s) trying to grab a few of the offenders. Although it's appreciated it does not even make a dent in the problem. Perhaps the road can be deemed for "local traffic only" at 18th & 62nd, heading East ? Whatever the solution, something needs to be done soon before an innocent person get's killed from a reckless driver. Thank you.	I want to Slow Down Traffic

this is a residential street being used as a commercial racetrack.our parking is at the street  and we cannot even safely access the back of our vehicle without risking our lives.

It should be moved over to the middle with swales and sidewalks on both sides for property owners and their children and pets safety.

Driver was honking and tailgating the car behind me. On west shore blvd a busy 2 lane no pass road he floored it into the illegal oncommmng lane passing the car behind me and myself.

HART Employee Behavior
Hi again,

Today the bus 30 traveling east was either 8 minutes early or more than 20 minutes late like it normally is about half the time. This has been an ongoing issue for the entire 3 years I've had to ride the buses. I'm going to contact our officials regarding the lack of transparency and disregard HART has had toward the people it has its purpose in serving. It's now 17 after and like normal it'll be more than a half hour before a bus comes to drop me off at a second stop where I'll likely be waiting again for a half hour - all to go as far as a car would in less than 10 minutes. This is but one reason people are embarrassed to ride the bus in Tampa. Thanks so much.	HART Arrival Times/Schedules
Since I started your paratransit service, the drivers have been nice and secure me well, but when it comes to driving it's a nightmare. After stopping at the railroad tracks, they accelerate so fast it jerks me forward and I'm forced back in my scooter. It hurts when I feel the bang as they stop aggressively. This has happened with all the drivers since I started.	HART Reckless Driving
I was waving at this driver and he just kept going passing me up at the bus stop, now I'm going to be late for my doctor's appointment.	HART Failure to Pick-up
The patron was not quite at the bus stop and the operator either waited or picked him up a little before the stop so that the patron didn't have to run.  He was very appreciative.	HART Commendation
The bus never passed by this stop.

The 60LX in the afternoon going from Downtown to NorthWest Transit Center...the times need to be adjusted.  People work downtown and normally get off work at 4pm and 5pm...The bus needs to be adjusted so that people can get to the bus stops and get on the bus.  Makes no sense for someone to miss the bus by 15 minutes and have to wait a hour until the next bus comes.  Just crazy!!! According to the schedule the bus leaves Marion at 4:01pm come on a person getting off work can not get to the Marion Transit in 1 minute if they get off work at 4pm.  Come on now!!!  Hart has got to do better.  

I catch the bus in the afternoon at Kennedy Blvd at Pierce St. at the MetroRapid bus stop ...please adjust the 60LX so I can catch it the bus comes too early and I get off at 4pm .  If the bus could get there at 4:08pm or 4:10pm I could make it and do NOT have to wait 1 long hour until the next bus arrives.  

Im sure this is a issue with other people that ride the 60LX as well.  Please adjust the time.  

Hope someone finally listens.	HART Arrival Times/Schedules

I have an issue with the bus app that doesn't really tell you if a bus has broken down or if it's not coming, because this morning I was waiting on the 6:11 a.m. Route 34 at Hillsborough Ave. and Halifax Dr. and the app kept saying it was 10 minutes away, then 5 minutes away, then all of a sudden the app started saying -3 minutes, and onward to -5 minutes and the bus never came at 6:11 a.m. When the bus finally got there at 6:40 a.m. I thought it was the next but, so when I told the lady driving that the previous bus never showed up, she said "I am the 6:11 a.m. bus, My bus broke down and I had to wait for a replacement." I think the app needs to let the customer know when things like this happens because we could take steps to get out of the cold or call a friend for a ride or something instead of waiting on the bus because the app says it's on it's way but in reality it isn't.

That is not a straight line route like if I was taking a fixed route bus. 
By law/guidelines, according to Departmemt of Transportation, the paratransit has to be comparable to that of a fixed route bus. There is no way in the world this route is comparable to that of the 2 buses I would take in order for me to get to MacDill AFB.
I have to be at work at 9am, I dont have to be at the Macdill Air Force Base main hate at 9am. Let me tell you all once again I DO NOT WORK AT THE MAIN GATE!!!!

You all take the law/guidelines and misconstrued them to your liking. I rely on Hart Plus because I have Epilepsy. This is a company that takes advantage of those with disabilities and treat them poorly. You all expect that they will just deal with the unjust, you are sadly mistaken.

I will file another complaint with the Department of Transportation. I have documented all of my trips that have taken me off of the straight line path.

There were several people waiting at the stop.  As the route 12 approached, we waved for the driver to stop.  She looked over at us and just kept driving.	HART Failure to Pick-up
When I searched the Route 12 at 6 am, there was no detour alert on One Bus Away for the MLK Day Parade on Monday, January 20. No one said anything and when I got off work I thought it would be over since it ended at 1 pm. I called at 4 pm, and it was still not showing. I need to know when this is going on, I can't walk with my five year old all the way to 34th and Lake.	OneBusAway
I have been waiting for the bus that was scheduled for 1pm, but the bus never showed up.  Everyone here is aware of the detour, but still no bus and this is very inconvenient! HART should not have operators working routes alone if they do not know the route and detours! Now I am late to where I need to be even though I was on time at the bus stop!	HART Failure to Pick-up
I was standing at the bus stop when the operator looked me dead in the eye and drove right passed me!  I've been on hold and had time to calm down, but I was so mad that I started crying! I've come all the way from the airport on route 32 and I'm so tired!  Even other people down the street were flagging her to stop for me, but she kept going!	HART Failure to Pick-up
The van is picking me up outside my window, and I think its unfair that if we are 5 minutes late, we get let and get a no show, and the v an can be 45 minutes late with no consequences.	HART Arrival Times/Schedules

The trash can is overflowing and there is trash is all over the ground on Seminole Heights Baptist Church property, in front of Mission Tampa, next to the muffler shop	HART Bus Stop Maintenance
This driver made a comment about my private life that I think has nothing to do with her. I was paying two Dollars for a Discount Pass, and showed her my HART ID, but I didn't have my other ID with me. She let me pay, but then said "You are cheap! You have a job and you pay Discount Fare." I think that is un called for and none of her business what type of fare I qualify for.	HART Employee Behavior
I was at the bus stop shelter, and started gathering my things when I saw the bus approaching. But when I realized it, the driver did not even do a complete stop, he had just slowed down and rolled by without picking me up. He was already late, and I'm not complaining about that, but he didn't even stop for a few seconds to give me a change to get on.	HART Employee Behavior
Waiting to get on the bus, and I asked the driver to lower the bus, because I have hip problems. The driver looked at me as if he didn't want to lower it. And when he did lower it, I asked him if he could lower it any more, and he yelled at me saying "are you getting on or what, because I'm closing the door, I don't want to miss the light". When I got on, he closed the door on me and I got pinched in the door. After I got on I made a mistake putting in the bus pass he yelled again "That isn't where the pass goes". When we got to UATC, I took a picture of him to show a supervisor and he then started yelling at me and acting like he was trying to fight me saying "I will whoop your old butt" and "You look like a Pedophile". I was verbally abused from the moment I stepped on that bus. I am requesting a call back from a manager, because I want something to happen to this driver.	HART Employee Behavior
Bus driver saw me and flew right passed me.	HART Employee Behavior
The caller would like to formally note that the increasing delays and late arrivals of HARTPlus trips are not fair or acceptable to the patrons. The caller commented that it is not fair for HARTPlus to be extremely late, but patrons get penalized for being more than 5 minutes late. The caller added that if vehicles are going to be late, there should be a courtesy call to the patrons letting them know that their vehicle is running late.	HART Arrival Times/Schedules
I was trying to get off the bus, and this driver kept opening and closing the door on me, and laughing about it as if it was a game to him.	HART Employee Behavior
I don't like the fact that the operator blows the horn twice and I have a "pet peeve" regarding this. I would much prefer that the operator knock the door to let me know they are there, this has been happening for at least the last three days. On top of that the operator was facing the opposite direction from our house, making my son have to cross the street .	HART Employee Behavior
I was standing at the bus stop and this driver passed my stop on the left lane and didn't pick me up. I'm pretty frustrated now, because I hope not to miss my connection at Downtown to go to work. I'm not sure why this driver was on the left lane, maybe passing another car or something.	HART Employee Behavior
I need to speak with a manager about this van being so late today, and still expecting the patrons to pay fare for an extremely late van. When the client is late 5 minutes, they are left behind, but the patron has no choice but to wait and still "pay" for a van that can be over 30 minutes late.	HART Arrival Times/Schedules
This operator is taking off without letting me even get to the first seat. And he sees I have a suitcase and my hands are full.	HART Employee Behavior
I asked the driver and motioned to her, so she could kneel the bus so I could get the bike on the rack. I feel the driver could see me and hear me, and she turned her head away as if deliberately ignoring me, when she finally acknowledged me, she barely tapped the switch and never attempted again to kneel it. But when she went to take her break, she lowered the bus all the way down without issue.  I have a disability and it is difficult for me to raise my bike. Also there was another incident I witnessed, when she came back from brake, and this happened at 12:30 PM, the other patron was needing to go Downtown and he was out of town, and he wanted to get to the Train station, but she was being rude to him too for no reason. If any supervisor needs to call me, please feel free to call.	HART Employee Behavior
This is the 3rd time this week that a bus driver gets lots and today it may cost me my job. This lady driving almost got into an accident 3 or 4 times and was lost for about 30 minutes. When we finally got to our area, she was not even able to drop us off on the correct stop so I had to end up walking to work, with a herniated disk in my back. I don't know who trains these drivers, but this was unacceptable. It's bad enough that every day this bus is up to 20 minutes late, but today we also got lost so I will be close to an hour late to work.	HART Employee Behavior
I was parked front-end into a parking space picking up my grandkids. When a white and blue HART Van pulled up along the driveway behind me, blocking me into my parking spot. When I asked the driver if he could back up just a bit so that I could get out, he said "I'll only be a minute in here, you can wait". I was shocked and said "Excuse me?" to which the driver replied to me "You heard me". And then he went about his business without letting me out. When he returned I told him that I was going to report him, and he said "Go ahead. I don't give a damn."	HART Employee Behavior
I would like to request that they do not send this operator to pick me up anymore. I have called before about this, and today this driver was reaching for his coffee thermos out of his cooler while driving at a speed over 60 miles per hour on the highway. In addition to that, he was trying to open the container and drink from it while driving, making him swerve out of the traffic lane and causing him to jerk the steering wheel to get back in the lane. At those high speeds, it is out right dangerous to do that, because we were almost being tossed in the back of the van every time he did this.	HART Employee Behavior
I hate to complain, but this driver was speeding and tailgating other cars on the expressway and hitting his brakes hard. I nearly fell out of my seat because this driver was going so fast and hitting brakes so hard.	HART Employee Behavior
I was waving at the bus driver and the bus still went on to the left lane to turn at the light, and didn't stop to pick me and my daughter up. Even the other lady on the other side of the street saw me wave at the driver.	HART Employee Behavior
For the past few weeks every day, these drivers that get on at the HART garage, when they come on the bus they are louder than some of the patrons onboard, and it's very disturbing.	HART Employee Behavior
	HART Comments and Suggestions
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART) you guys  have buses that are number in the 2900s & 1000s that have exhaust fumes that comes inside the bus when the exhaust light indicator comes on & it's very hard to breath & i have complain to the HART bus operators many of times but the maintenance shop does not fix the problems what so ever & also on some of the operators driver seats does not always lock into place & when they press on their brakes i have witness some of the operators flying into the steering wheel & almost losing control of the bus & i believe all of this is very dangerous & if i get hurt or get sick from the exhaust fumes me & my attorney  Morgan & Morgan will be filing a million dollar lawsuit against the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART).	HART Comments and Suggestions
A better fare card should be considered. If the numbers on the card fade away, when I go to swipe my card it will not read and the operators give me a hard time.	HART Comments and Suggestions

Dear HART Administrator,

I am a Military Service Member and a 24LX rider.  I’d like to thank you for the service you provide to the citizens of Hillsborough County and for your continue support during these troubling times.  Earlier this week you announced that bus lines 20LX, 24LX, and 25LX were temporarily discontinued.  I respectfully request to reconsider the following suggestion:
Could you please run at least one 24LX bus line instead of your usual five to help support the citizens who are still supporting City and Military operations Downtown and at MacDill, AFB.  I understand that right now it is not very cost effective to run the usual five 24LX lines, but maybe finding a “happy medium” could show your continue support to City workers and the Military.  Maybe just running either the 0600 or 0640 line out of the FishHawk Sports Complex Park and Ride and the 1600 or 1640 line out of the Florida Keys Avenue stop might help until ridership goes back to a sustainable level.

During this reduction in service and if the above does not work for you, could you please consider, if running the full 24LX route from all the way to FishHawk is unsustainable, maybe just running it from the Riverview Oaks Park and Ride to Downtown and to MacDill, AFB.  You choose the time and I’m sure customers will show up.

Maybe do the same for 20LX and 25LX?  Just one temporary bus line until normalcy?

Additionally, once we return to normal bus schedules, would you consider, out of the five 24LX lines you run, having one 24 “Super Express” that take Military and Civilians directly to MacDill, AFB without stopping Downtown?  This is just a future consideration.  Your current reduction in service is what has given riders an additional economic strain and your public service is supposed to provide just that…an essential service to the public.  I thank you for that!

I appreciate your consideration and deliberation on this matter and please provide us some feedback.

Driver #720 is indeed a pleasure riding with.  His driving techniques (one I wished other would emulate) uses a smooth transition from accelerator to brake.  This comes from years of positive professional driving habits and not radical from those who only know the accelerator and the brake pedal (and nothing in between).  He's always prompt and gets us to wprk on time.  Clone him!	HART Commendation

I live on Powhatan Avenue, the back of my house faces Henry Ave. Someone on Henry uses your service in the morning to get picked up around 6 am, and the driver announces their arrival by back up down the block, signaling their backup alarm which in turn wakes up my 2 month old daughter. Is there any way they could somehow let their fare know they're there without setting off an ear piercing series of beeps at 6 am? Thank you!	HART Comments and Suggestions

This stop is dangerous and should be moved.  It is at MacDill and Granada serving Northbound Route 574 (South Tampa Flex).  There is on-street parking directly in front of it.  If someone is parked there bus patrons must step partially into the street to be seen by the driver, which puts them at risk of being hit by a passing motorist.  Better locations for this stop would be either north of Barcelona, in front of Datz Deli, which has a parking lot, or MacDill and Santiago, under the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway and just before the right turn lane for traffic going onto northbound Bay To Bay starts.

Bus stop ID unknown—Intersection of S Obrien and Idaho in Port Tampa. Route 17. Bus Number 1709. Liscense plate TP0954. Time 6:21 PM.

The bus operator was flying down Idaho so fast, it blew dust in my eyes on the sidewalk on the other side of the street on a windless day. It was FLYING and I could hear the accelerator still being pressed 50 yards from the bus stop. There were two children on one bike stopped on the curb of the bus stop facing with the flow of traffic—at a reasonable speed these children should not have been in danger and were not in the road. The driver slammed on the break and laid on the horn for the children to move as the bus skid to a stop. The children left my view as the bus overtook them but did ride away after the incident.

I was instinctively afraid for my own safety (although perhaps unreasonably given my proximity to the road) when the bus whooshed past because Vehicles rarely go that fast on Idaho. But I thought I’d be calling an ambulance for those children. This isn’t the first time the Rout 17 bus has gone too fast down Idaho, but I will say it doesn’t happen every time I see it. This IS the first time I’ve seen it the that speed and skid to a stop. Very unsafe. Please address the issue. The driver and bus can be seen in the attached photo.	HART Employee Behavior

Hi,

I arrived 5 minutes early and have not seen the bus, now the bus is more than 5 minutes late for the next one, so I have been waiting at 1 bus stop for more than 40 minutes now and still no bus. This is a pretty common issue and, the buses are not scheduled to link up with other routes for example, the bus 30 is scheduled to show up at Howard Avenue 3 minutes after the bus 14 is scheduled to go north from that location.

Bus #6 approaching Nebraska and Columbus going north before the Checkers there was a pedestrian in the distance that looked like he was dancing. The driver didn't stop but he did move away and accelerated as he got close. The pedestrian then fell and the bus hit the brakes. When he did, I lunged forward and hit my arm. There were other bus drivers and people there in the bus. I know this was a safety issue because the bus driver yielded but did not slow down and the braking made everyone go forward.

Due to a lack of available parking, parents often park in the middle of the street and also park in reserved parking spaces that are for teachers, causing a backup cycle of compounded issues and problems.  The parents often walk there children in to school and leave their vehicles unattended.  The students, parents and school staff are unable to predict which cars have people in them and which are parked, making for a dangerous situation for children to be in.  We have crossing guards on the sides of the schools but not in the front or back of the school where there are observable problems.  Perhaps additional crossing guards placed in front and in back of the school would help alleviate the danger and perhaps an enforcement officer can help prevent parents from parking in reserved spaces.

We've been under construction for a few months and our road has been tore up.  Now it has been paved and we have to wait a month before the speed bumps go back in.  In the mean time, people are going sooo very fast down our long straight road, someone is going to be hurt.  Even while the road was under construction, the workers were dealing with crazy speeders.  I have a video of a woman riding her scooter down the sidewalk.  There is also a man that drives his motor cycle down the sidewalk.  He has since stopped since we are paved now.  Someone is going to get hurt.  The police could sit and watch the speeders at one end of the street and give out tickets at the other end.  Thank you for your time.	Report a Traffic Safety Issue

Dear Sir/Madam

Please help clear dumped household waste, from the empty lot.
To help out, the Inkberry Court Homeowners Association.

This happens repeatedly, even after a warning sign, was added
to the lamp post.  Waste is dumped on the grass and the road.

Which spoils the view for the 12 properties, on Inkberry Court.
And is a health and safety issue, if on road, and harbors pests.

There is also graffiti, paint sprayed on the lamp post, under
the street signs.  Please can it be jet washed off, and the
street signs, be made level, and straight.

This is a minor adjustment, but we are trying to smarten up
1050 Inkberry Court, empty lot, as apart from the dumping
this cul-de-sac, is now an exceptional area.

Thank you, very much, Mayor Dyer, for your help, with this.

Yours sincerely

Mr James Walters

A large laurel oak at 1916 Weber Street (on the northwest corner of the lot close to the driveway of 1912 Weber Street), has been dropping small and medium-sized branches onto the sidewalk and onto the driveway of 1912 Weber Street. In 2018, a much larger branch fell onto the street light and electrical pole, knocking out power for multiple residents. OUC came to trim the tree, but only removed minor branches touching the power lines. The branches that fall regularly (2 to 6 inches in diameter) are infested with ants and other insects. Many of them are dry-rotted and perforated with termite holes. The owner of 1916 Weber Street has removed most of the branches over their yard, leaving an uneven and unstable tree hanging over 1912 Weber Street, the sidewalk, and the utility pole.

There needs to be left turn signal lights added to those on primrose turning onto 50. I come that way home during rush hour and the amount of people heading N on primrose turning Right onto Colonial is astounding. It leaves no chance for those going S on primrose and turning Left onto Colonial to turn. Those people turning Left onto Colonial literally take chances that people will be considerate and allow you to turn at the same time as them. And as we know people are not considerate these days. The amount of horn blaring and barely missed wrecks I’ve seen/ been subjected to is insane. Not to mention those who wait for NO traffic before they turn causes you to sit through several unnecessary lights. I just hope you take this into serious consideration. It really wouldn’t cause too much of a difference in the traffic flow and would do a LOT of help. The turn lights can be triggered so if cars stop going then it immediately switches.

A large limb fell yesterday morning over the driveway and street and was removed by the city Pre-storm, thankfully. We would like the tree looked at to see if it is healthy. It is holding a lot of water in the middle and if it spilts it will hit the house. I removed most things from the LR Incase it split during the storm.

Good morning,

I would like to report an illegal appliance repair and sale business being operated from a residential address at 2918 E Central Blvd. I spoke with Katy yesterday who confirmed it’s a non-conforming use of an R-1A/T/AN residence. 

Tenant Jonathan Hynes is running the business from a shed in the back yard. The yard is full of cars and the front yard is full of washer/dryer “shells” as he scavenges units for parts and leaves the remnants at the curd for the city to deal with instead of transporting them to the dump.

In case he tries to deny it when you investigate or down play it saying it was just a one-off, private transaction selling his personal washer and dryer, I attached a photo of an excerpt from the conversation I had with him where he references having multiple sets for sale out of the residence. He told me it is a “full time business” and that he normally has “five or six units for sale” from the shed at any given time.

Kindly,
Tim	Report Code Violation - Other

I live in Condominium community. I saw where 4336 S Kirkman RD unit 714 made alterations to the walls inside their unit. Concerned about structural integrity remaining, I asked the community office if this modification was permitted and/or approved. The association said they had no records of approvas, permits or even requests for interior wall modifications. At this moment I do not see the office doing anything about my concern. Since this is a Condominium, not a single family home, I am concerned about the safety of my kids and others if any structure was affected by this modification.  Can you please investigate this?

Speeding on Bumby Ave between Lake Como and Curry Ford is a persistent problem and it is putting students, pedestrians, and cyclists in extreme risk. The posted speed limit is 25 mph, however, drivers consistently exceed the posted speed limit and it is not uncommon for drivers to speed well over 45-50 mph. During school arrival and dismissal times the school zone is only posted at 20 mph and is rarely enforced. As a parent who walks with a child to school I have only seen officers stopping speeders two times in the last two years.

There must be a solution to slow drivers down before someone is seriously injured or killed. This section of Bumby Ave is narrow and lacks curbs. A distracted speeding driver could easily drift onto the sidewalk and strike a student or pedestrian. Please consider installing speed humps, posting more visible speed limit signs, adding a stop sign on Bumby at the intersection with Walnut where the frequently ignored crosswalk is located. Also, please consider increasing enforcement of the current posted speed limit. 

With the temporary closing of the Mills underpass at 408, traffic has increased dramatically and this issue requires immediate attention.	Report a Traffic Safety Issue

The timing of the light is not as efficient as it should be. It gives too much time for each street's "turn" at moving through the intersection. The length of time for each green should be lowered so that each direction has more chances to go because it is mostly single car traffic. Also, during event nights (Orlando City, Magic), it needs to let more cars through heading northbound on Parramore Ave. The poor timing results in many cars sitting for way too long at an empty traffic light.

This is 1 of many photos I have of people driving in the park. Using it to teach kids how to drive circling around my dog and I in the back lot. Or using it as a place to go mudding with their trucks. Others feel it’s ok to drive into park and use as a driving range. This man actually feels it’s ok to hit his golf ball towards the bathrooms over there. Yep- by the side walk. Hit them directly at me. 
Oh he stops when he thinks your close... 

So: 
Is the parking lots just a suggestion?? 
Should we all just drive into the park - park our cars at will wherever and do literally whatever we want? 
Should I just post online for everyone to drive into the park because no one cares?  
And being I have called multiple times over more than 3 months on this and nothing is done to prevent this such as finishing putting fence up so doesn’t happen- Who exactly should I name in lawsuit if my dog or myself are injured from being hit by a golf ball or a car just driving around inside a park??

While I have you regarding bag stations. It would really be helpful if there was a bag pole/station installed by the east end entrance to the 408 walkway on the North side near the main parking. That way someone could grab a bag BEFORE  beginning the long walk as you can at the opposite end. Love Lake Underhill. Thanks for helping to make it so pretty and enjoyable.

Attached are (3) pictures of the front/side yard of my home here in Randal Park at Lake Nona. 
Address is: 10549 Billings Street Orlando, FL 32832. 

When the construction of my home occurred back in 2013, it appears that a French Drain was never installed (though should have been). My home happens to be the one on the street with the PadMounted Transformer box that distributes power to a number of homes on my street. Additionally, the telecommunications box sits right next to it, for cable and internet distribution. 

Despite the rest of my yard being bone dry, the side yard, and more importantly, the area around the two electrical boxes and buried water meter, sit in around the clock water. So much water in fact that a recent service call by my neighbor to a cable company refused to work in the area as he deemed it “dangerous”. 

I’m afraid not addressing the issue will cause more damage than just sod in the long run, and even run the risk of electrocution after a heavy rain. Any advice and assistance is much appreciated and long overdue.

I certainly appreciate your expeditious investigation of this matter.	Report Code Violation - Other

At 1201 Sweetbriar Rd., there is a very large Oak tree between the sidewalk and the curb near the mailbox. Sadly, chunks and branches of the dying tree fall regularly, even on windless, rainless days, one had caused property damage to a vehicle. It hangs perilously over the sidewalk and home.	Report a Problem Tree
Since my last request, branches and bark have continued to fall; branches the size of which could seriously injury or kill someone.  To reiterate, this tree is a hazard to persons and property.  It is by luck that it has not dropped a branch on passersby and it is seems likely to fall on our home when it gives out.  One of the city of Orlando's tree cutting crew who was on my property (because another tree collapsed blocking the street) told me the oak in front of my home was in very bad shape.  I agreed, as a large branch had already fallen and damaged my car.  He said it was dying and he would never park a car in my driveway because of it. I told him I had sent a request to have this tree, which is in the city right of way, looked at.  Someone came and cut 1 to 3 inch low hanging branches that were overhanging the street by a foot or two.  The crew member laughed and said those little ones were called "sucker" branches.  He implored me to reach out to the city again, directly if necessary. He noted that where it was planted, a raised brick enclosure, was not a healthy spot. I wrote the city director directly in May.  I have received no response.  Since then, branches continue to fall, and the tree continues to hang ominously over our home.  Last week,  a branch 10 inches in diameter and 5 feet in length landed on the sidewalk.  From the height it fell, it would have seriously injured, possibly killed anyone struck in the head by it.  This type of branch dropping has been continuous.  I have no intention of becoming a nuisance, I understand the City of Orlando has its citizen's best interests at heart and balances that with the need to keep the city green, something we agree with, having 12 other oaks on the property and having requested 3 more oaks from the City's tree planting program (a fourth if this oak can be removed and replaced with a live oak).  But I must continue to press the danger of this tree.  Thank you again.	Report a Problem Tree

If you look toward the front of our home, the tree in the ROW on the right side of the mailbox appears to have an infestation.  It has never thrived and appears to be struggling with something.  Several branches toward the inside of the tree have died and/or fallen off.  If it does have an infestation, I would love for it to be treated.  If there is a more serious problem, I would love to have it replaced.  Thank you.	Report a Problem Tree
The growth of a City tree in the easement is being obstructed by the limbs of a private tree on our property.  The large limb from the tree on our private property is hanging over/on top of the City tree and into/over the street.  A piece of that limb recently fell (wasn't too huge, we cleaned it up).  Just concerned because the tree in the easement is being so crowded by this limb (and a few smaller limbs).  Would like to request someone come take a look.  Thank you very much.

We have people dumping trash, tires, hazardous waste (oil, paint, other chemicals) in the lot by Ave C and 5th Street.  This area is partially fenced but the people drive around to an open spot where they can drive a truck in and dump these waste products. The area is overgrown with brush and weeds which hides these trucks.  What is needed is for the city to clear the brush and completely fence in this lot.  Also noticed groups of cars (2-3) going into this area and staying for extended times (sometimes overnight).	Report Code Violation - Other

This specific tree is located on city property. I contacted your department last spring and was assured that someone would come and look at it.  As of today they have not. The tree was hit by lightning and is split from the ground up to the top. I fear the top is becoming more unstable. Please contact me about inspecting it.

The Owner is having an addition built to the back of her house, without any signs of a permit. Ordinarily, I would not even think about whether there was a permit, but she's been renting out the back of her house for several years.  The addition will either give her additional rooms to rent to more separate renters or will allow her to put more renters into the current space. In either case, this is further disregard to the neighbors and our used-to-be single family neighborhood -- and it at least should be done with City cognizance and permitting.

There is excessive speeding on Thornton Lane from 4PM-6PM M-F as it is used as a cut through street during heavy traffic times. We (our neighborhood) would like to request a traffic study for Thornton Lane. As you can see from the attached picture, neighbors are desperately trying to calm the speeding by buying yard signs. There are children and pets that live on the street and we are concerned for our and their safety. 

Additionally, would like to know the process of requesting a reduction of the speed limit from 25 MPH to 15 MPH. A traffic study was done in the past and showed 24-hour volumes between 267 and 294 vehicles with 85th percentile speed between 22.1 and 22.8 miles per hour. The number of vehicles and speeding have visible increased since the study was done. Another thing to take into consideration in the length of the street. For vehicles to reach 22 mph in such a short stretch of road shows that their acceleration rates must be alarmingly high. 

We would like to also request a 3 way stop sign at E. Jackson Street and Thornton Lane. It is challenging for the homeowners at 236, 238, 300, and 306 Thornton Lane to pull out of their driveway due to the high traffic at the end of their driveway at Jackson/Thornton Lane. 

Lastly, there is poor street lighting between 228 Thornton Lane and 230 Thornton Lane. There is a street pole already in place and if street lighting was added this it would resolve the low visibility and safety concerns. We have a lot of crime in the neighborhood. 

Thank you for your help in advance!	Report Speeding In Your Neighborhood

There is a low frequency noise that is constantly reverberating from an unknown source which has been causing unwanted problems sleeping. It sounds like a motor possibly from a water pumping or booster station in our area. It is most prominent in quieter early morning hours particularly 4:30 to 6:30 am. This noise regularly disturbs sleep and awakens family members. It is considered a detrimental health issue. This was first noticed in late 2016 but is still a problem today.	Code Enforcement

On Thursday at 1704, traffic was backed up through the light in the 2 left turn lanes (exiting US19 at Rt. 580) through the exit lane onto US 19.  That is a long way for traffic to be backed up since it was past the turn lane.  It took 4 light changes  for me finally to be able to turn left.  You need to lengthen the green light for off rampers turning left at this exchange to provide a safer exit..   Why does the length of this light keep changing?  There is a serious issue here with traffic backup up onto the highway.	Traffic Signal Issue
Hwy 19S frontage & SR 580. The left turn lane on SR 580 westbound has 2 turn lanes to enter Hwy 19S frontage. The turn lanes are divided with lane markers until the pedestrian crosswalk.

The traffic light only turns green for 5 seconds for traffic coming off of 19 turning onto Main Street (SR 580) westbound.

Please make the green light last for 10-15 seconds.

As of now, there is only enough time for 2-3 cars to make the arrow legally, even though there are a stack of cars waiting to make the turn.

People running the arrow could cause an accident that could have been prevented with a longer green arrow.

While listening to the news this morning on 970 WFLA A.M. it was mentioned about an accident on Curlew Road and Countryside Blvd. in Clearwater either yesterday or this morning.  It was a car on Curlew that made a turn into a man on a motorcycle.  It caught my attention because I live on Curlew and have to travel it a lot.  The County or someone has set up the traffic lights now on this road where almost always a driver on Curlew who wants to turn gets into the turn lane and has a yellow flashing light to turn.  This is the most frightening and dangerous situation because cars are coming at you and cars are in the turn lane facing you crossing the opposite way.  You can not see cars coming because the cars in the turn lane are blocking your view.  You are forced to try to shoot across to turn and you can’t see cars coming.  I believe that is just what happened to this motorcyclist.  He was traveling in the lane close to the turn lane probably very fast because everyone goes 60 mph or more on the road.  The car was trying to turn and couldn’t see the motorcyclist and they ran into each other.  The County needs to change this and give people on Curlew Road just a regular light change, green turn arrow and yellow just for drivers in the ongoing lanes.  Would you bring this to someone's attention who can change this?  It is the worst set up I have ever seen all the way down Curlew and maybe in a lot of places.  It is insane.	Traffic Signal Issue
The traffic light at this intersection is not timing correctly, and only 1-3 cars are able to turn; traffic is stacking up every morning very badly on Curlew.	Other
From Curlew Rd as you are in the turn lane to turn south onto Countryside Blvd I see that the yellow blinking light is still in operation. This needs to be changed to a red and green turn arrows for safety reasons. There have been several accidents/deaths as a result of this turning lane. The last resulted in the death of an innocent victim from an accident on June 30, 2015. The problem is that the oncoming turn lane (for those trying to turn north onto Countryside Blvd) restricts the view of eastbound traffic on Curlew Rd making it difficult for those turning south onto Countryside Blvd to see oncoming traffic. In addition, the eastbound traffic on Curlew is travelling with the momentum of a downhill slope while the turn lane drivers are going from a dead stop into an uphill progression. It's a very dangerous combination of factors. To keep the yellow blinking light would seem almost negligent to me on the county's part.  Please see for yourself the danger involved particularly during rush-hour traffic.	Traffic Signal Issue
entered same complaint a couple weeks ago...this light is cycling when it shouldn't. at 415AM it changes when no traffic is at intersection - it should stay green for Curlew traffic unless there is traffic approaching from Countryside Blvd. The light cycles so quickly almost all traffic ends up stopping there for no reason.

I sit and watch the other direction of traffic go and our signal never turns green. I have to sit through multiple rounds of lights thinking the next one will turn green and it doesn't. Again this has happened several days in a row now and is becoming frustrating. I have to then get back on Curlew and make a U-turn farther down the road so I'm not late for work.	Traffic Signal Issue
Traffic light at Curlew Rd and Countryside Blvd is malfunctioning. For the past few weeks, at 4AM for Curlew traffic going west, it will change from green to red for no reason (no traffic pending on Countryside Blvd) and then immediately change back to green. When I say "immediately", I mean it is only red for maybe 1 second before going green again.	Traffic Signal Issue

This intersection has had multiple accidents!!  There is a flashing yellow light that is confusing to some. Generally, a yellow light means caution & the light will be turning red. The new flashing yellow has shown up at many intersections. We have witnessed MANY times that people actually speed up at a yellow flashing to “make the light before it turns red”, rather than using caution to only turn if clear.  This flashing yellow is a new thing.  We have many older drivers that are not aware & going with what they have always done. Not a good idea to change something that can have such a big impact.

How can I request a 'Watch for Kids' traffic sign for my street? People use Winding Wood Dr as a through street and go past the posted speed limit. Between my house and my 2 side neighbors we have a total of 10 kids who play out front. We watch them to make sure they don't go into the streets but I'd like a sign; anything to help people take watch and alert them of small children out front.	Traffic Signal Issue
On a daily basis, we see FedEx and UPS drivers in particular speeding down Winding Wood Drive. It is a 25 MPH zone and they are going well above the speed limit.

The home at 735 Elm street has been abandoned for quite some time. The roof is in serious bad shape with extensive termite damage and holes or openings into the attic space.  The openings are allowing wild animals (ie. Racoons) to climb up the walls and get into the home where they are living, eating, reproducing, and defecating (pooping/ peeing). We have seen these animals enter and leave out of the home. In addition due to the roof damage, there is probably a lot of mold, roaches, rats, etc inside home which all pose a public health hazard.

Drain appears to be plugged, pond formed in open SE corner of lot	Ditch Obstruction
Hello,

Immediately behind our home that is under construction at 755 Elm Street, Safety Harbor there is a Pinellas county preserve area. The last time I walked into the preserve area (about a year ago) to explore I found lots of debris / trash from tires, toilets, old TV sets, stack of masonry block, cups, carpet and even an old vintage refrigerator with missing door but laying right side up. There is lots of debris items all of which are potential to collect water and I don't believe anyone has come to clean it up to control the mosquitos. There is a creek that runs from McMullen that flows thru this preserve and next to our future home. From what I recall there is even a pond close if not inside this preserve. Recently during the course of our home construction while I work out there I have notice multiple mosquitos biting during the day, a little more after it rains and a lot when the sun is going down. Recently my wife and I just found out she is pregnant and with this whole thing with ZIka in Pinellas, we especially don't want to be getting the Zika Virus. We have asked that Mosquito Control please put this preserve on their daily route of spraying but last time we spoke with someone recently they said that this preserve is not on the regular route. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have someone go and clean up the water collecting debris and please put this preserve on the regular route for spraying. Please call me for more info.

Thanks

I called a couple of weeks ago about Tree limbs and brush in the easement behind our condo at Hammock pines. Someone came yesterday and today to clean that area up and did a wonderful job. They worked very hard and should be commended.  Thank-you for getting this done for us.  There is one thing I would like to add.  There is a small creek that runs along the fence line that  has several branches and large leaves from some banana trees that are falling into the creek and along the fence that they could not reach.  It could restrict the flow of water in the creek but not sure until a hard rain fall.  And there are also several large broken branches hung up in the two trees bordering this fence line that could fall. This would  probably take a bucket lift to get that high.  We are only at our condo for a few months at a time but I am pretty sure this tree damage, etc was caused by hurricane IRMA. Thank-you again for your prompt response to having this area cleaned up.

I walk north through Safety Harbor, up main street, south on McMullen Booth and back into Safety Harbor on SR590 3 to 4 times a week. You had tree clearing and new sidewalks put in because of the cracking on the east side of McMullen Booth, which are very nice. However, you did not finish the job with the sidewalks there are still cracked sidewalks just south of Main Street Safety Harbor. One very large problem is a tree/bush/weed that's growing out and onto the sidewalk out of some kind of water/ well hole, that constantly keeps the sidewalk wet. This Saturday morning I slipped through the slime and mud and fell at this wet spot. It is always an extreme measure to walk past the spot and I don't understand why it is left in this condition.  I am lucky at 52 years old that all I got was skinned up and "hopefully just" a twisted knee and hip and nothing more.  Hopefully by the time you get this fixed there is nobody that gets hurt worse. It is a major safety problem. Please contact me Sheryl Hollen-Hugg , 727-512-4031, srhollen@gmail.com. I have plenty of pictures to show you!	Sidewalk Repair

I was in the left hand turn lane from sunset going east to turn onto North mcmullen booth (going towards enterprise). The light only stays green for about 4-5 seconds and it is creating huge backups. I typically sit there for 10 minutes+ and always sit through at least 2 turn cycles before I can go.	Traffic Signal Issue
Just this week I have noticed that the length of time for the light turning West onto Sunset Point Road from McMullen-Booth has been reduced a lot. It only stays green for about six seconds (I timed it). This is leading to a lot of people going through the red light. 

It used to be much longer. At least long enough to accommodate the traffic turning there around 5pm (when I go through).	Traffic Signal Issue

This has been a new change to the configuration and timing for the traffic.  The Left turn to go north on McMullen Booth has to wait much longer than all of the other traffic. When it turns most drivers are sleeping and don't move when it turns green.  Then only 3 cars can pass through the light.  It seems to be the most odd configuration. Many drivers are going through a red light and that is dangerous.  I believe this needs to be revisited to allow morning drivers have an appropriate time frame to pass through the intersection.

Thank you	Traffic Signal Issue
The left turn signals at this intersection were recently changed so that both left turn lanes from McMullen Booth onto Sunset Point no longer go at the same time as has been the case for many years.  It appears that the left turn from McMB southbound onto eastbound Main St normally goes last after the straightthru lanes have gone.  The left turn lane is already much too short for the amount of cars that line up to turn left in high traffic times and weekends so that cars are often backed up into the leftmost straightthru lane.  Since that left turn lane no longer clears first the line has gotten longer and cars coming over the rise (which makes them blind to the backup until they are right on it) going straight don't expect the left straight ahead lane to be blocked.  That change seemed to be very foolish given the circumstances and was just asking for a bad accident, one of which occurred earlier this evening.  Consideration needs to be given to extending that turn lane to hold a sufficient number of cars going back to the top of the rise so it is visible.  And in the short term at have the left turn signal go green first so that the lane can clear before the straightthru traffic begins moving.  I live in Safety Harbor and use that lane frequently and have been meaning to contact the county since noticing the change but was now prompted after seeing that accident today.  Since what I've described is pretty much common sense then hopefully others have made the same suggestion.	Traffic Signal Issue

b) from US 19 South people taking U turn and entering in the drive thru
c) from Sunset Point Rd -E turning right

To add to the misery there is a PSTA bus stop right after it.

Multiple times I have seen School Buses almost getting hit as they try to avoid the traffic jam at the intersection (due to long drive thru line).

It is a BIG traffic nightmare especially during morning office and school pick up hours and Dunkin Donuts should be asked to change the drive thru route as it is a BIG traffic hazard and a big ACCIDENT in waiting!!

Thank you,

With the increase traffic on 590 between McMullen booth and 19, it has become increasingly hard to cross 590 traffic and request possible walkway with blinking lights be installed. 590 is the only cross thru that has no pedestrian walkway yet it is the one with the most residences. Drew and sunset pt have lighted crosswalks.	Sidewalk Repair

While visiting a friend I saw that balcony spindles do not meet current code standards - they are VERY far apart. Even an adult person can fit through technically. It is Very dangerous for kids, if a kid slips through he can fall from the balcony easily. Same thing with the spindles around the units in the center of the building, which you have to go by to get to your front door. (see images attached)	Code Enforcement

A hole is developing in the road (not a pothole) - it appears to be collapsing likely due to a small sinkhole below the pavement. Over the course of the last 2-3 days, a relatively deep indentation in the roadway approximately 1-2 ft in diameter has developed. As of 9/14/16 at 10:00pm, the pavement around the divot had started to crack and the bottom of the hole was wet, despite there being no rain. There was no noticeable bump in the road this past weekend - this hole is developing very quickly. With the heavy boat-towing traffic that this road receives, in addition to theater patrons attending performances this week at this location, this could cause serious issues, especially if it continues to expand.

The street that is perpendicular to Bay Ave, across from the Episcopal Church of the Ascension, has become a thoroughfare for drivers as it shares space with the new Historical Museum for Clearwater, the Lifeworks Clinic, and residents in this area, as well as a cut-through for drivers on Alt. 19.  Years ago, it was paved, then approximately 5 years ago, the pot  holes were filled, now it is a mess of pot holes.  I contacted the City Engineer, Paul, and he said his supervisor declined my request to fill the pot holes as this is not considered a street.  It is a street and is being used more and more frequently and is presenting a danger to the neighborhood.  So, it now has a street name "Mulberry" and it was paved once upon a time, and the pot holes were filled years ago, and I do think it requires our tax dollars to at least fill these pot holes again.

A number of us in the neighborhood have reported this site many times now.  There are unlicensed workers there and know several inspectors have been out.  JD Travis Miller, a known fmr felon, is the lead and since the reports now works with his team of other unlicensed and no workers comp for team late at night!  The noise is ridiculous but more importantly, there still are no permits on file other than roof and they are doing the entire house and have been doing full remodel including windows, paint, bathroom and kitchen plumbing and electric.   We have kids that need to go to school in the morning and can't sleep due to the noise etc.  Thought Pinellas was cracking down on all this unlicensed activity.	Code Enforcement

During the evening rush from about 445-6pm, the traffic heading north that is exiting the Bayside bridge to head east onto SR-60 backs up a good amount...sometimes I count 40-50+ cars backed up on the bridge waiting to try and turn/merge onto Gulf to Bay to head towards the Courtney Campbell.  I know this is rush time but is there a way to give a little bit more time on our light to allow more cars to safely exit as the backup is causing the already existing Bayside bridge traffic to be even more congested.  

I am not sure if you can also pass this off to the Sheriff but on the Bayside bridge in the morning going south around 7-730am, there is a heavy amount of speeders and reckless drivers going well over the posted speed limit.  Thanks!	Traffic Signal Issue
Cars are again backing up on the Bayside bridge northbound where they exit to get onto Gulf to Bay Blvd.  A good amount of traffic turns east to go over the Courtney Campbell but there tends to be little time for drivers to safely enter the road.

The 2 turn lanes for drivers on SR-60 west who are trying to turn north to enter the Bayside bridge are backing up a lot more and the light cycle timing seems to be a cause of this.

Can we please get this light cycle looked at, more time added to it and perhaps a better cycle to clear those cars.  Seems to happen between 645-745am.	Traffic Signal Issue

Not a boat, but a school bus. Repeatly we have complained to the PCSB about a bus that includes a bus driver that insists on riding up on our lawn and moving rocks, and now destroying our reflectors. My next course of action is to install 5 foot rebar, as my yard is being ripped apart. Once rainy season starts it will become worse. The solution we see is to enforce better parking from the neighbor across the street. He has a truck and large box trailer that blocks the road and the bus is unable to make the turn. Instead of finding another route they insist on just riding up on the lawn. Plus they have hit the street sign and now it leans. So we need someone to take a look at this please. We will be taking pictures. Tammy Rippel	PSTA - Bus Stops

Thank you.	Road Issue

I walk north through Safety Harbor, up main street, south on McMullen Booth and back into Safety Harbor on SR590 3 to 4 times a week. You had tree clearing and new sidewalks put in because of the cracking on the east side of McMullen Booth, which are very nice. However, you did not finish the job with the sidewalks there are still cracked sidewalks just south of Main Street Safety Harbor. One very large problem is a tree/bush/weed that's growing out and onto the sidewalk out of some kind of water/ well hole, that constantly keeps the sidewalk wet. This Saturday morning I slipped through the slime and mud and fell at this wet spot. It is always an extreme measure to walk past the spot and I don't understand why it is left in this condition.  I am lucky at 52 years old that all I got was skinned up and "hopefully just" a twisted knee and hip and nothing more.  Hopefully by the time you get this fixed there is nobody that gets hurt worse. It is a major safety problem. Please contact me Sheryl Hollen-Hugg , 727-512-4031, srhollen@gmail.com. I have plenty of pictures to show you!	Sidewalk Repair

I was in the left hand turn lane from sunset going east to turn onto North mcmullen booth (going towards enterprise). The light only stays green for about 4-5 seconds and it is creating huge backups. I typically sit there for 10 minutes+ and always sit through at least 2 turn cycles before I can go.	Traffic Signal Issue
Just this week I have noticed that the length of time for the light turning West onto Sunset Point Road from McMullen-Booth has been reduced a lot. It only stays green for about six seconds (I timed it). This is leading to a lot of people going through the red light. 

It used to be much longer. At least long enough to accommodate the traffic turning there around 5pm (when I go through).	Traffic Signal Issue

This has been a new change to the configuration and timing for the traffic.  The Left turn to go north on McMullen Booth has to wait much longer than all of the other traffic. When it turns most drivers are sleeping and don't move when it turns green.  Then only 3 cars can pass through the light.  It seems to be the most odd configuration. Many drivers are going through a red light and that is dangerous.  I believe this needs to be revisited to allow morning drivers have an appropriate time frame to pass through the intersection.

Thank you	Traffic Signal Issue
The left turn signals at this intersection were recently changed so that both left turn lanes from McMullen Booth onto Sunset Point no longer go at the same time as has been the case for many years.  It appears that the left turn from McMB southbound onto eastbound Main St normally goes last after the straightthru lanes have gone.  The left turn lane is already much too short for the amount of cars that line up to turn left in high traffic times and weekends so that cars are often backed up into the leftmost straightthru lane.  Since that left turn lane no longer clears first the line has gotten longer and cars coming over the rise (which makes them blind to the backup until they are right on it) going straight don't expect the left straight ahead lane to be blocked.  That change seemed to be very foolish given the circumstances and was just asking for a bad accident, one of which occurred earlier this evening.  Consideration needs to be given to extending that turn lane to hold a sufficient number of cars going back to the top of the rise so it is visible.  And in the short term at have the left turn signal go green first so that the lane can clear before the straightthru traffic begins moving.  I live in Safety Harbor and use that lane frequently and have been meaning to contact the county since noticing the change but was now prompted after seeing that accident today.  Since what I've described is pretty much common sense then hopefully others have made the same suggestion.	Traffic Signal Issue

East Grapefruit Circle is a small road that connects from one busy Street to another busy Street. There are maybe 7-8 homes from one stop sign to the other. All of the neighbors, have children or/and dogs. My neighbor let's her kids grab the mail from the mailbox at times. Recently, we found our mailbox damaged like someone hit it with their vehicle. Drivers drive through our street at 45mph when the speed limit is 25mph. One afternoon, I was backing up from my own driveway when this car speeding, didn't even slow down/stop and went into our front yard to continue through. I have drove home on our street to someone almost hit me straight on because they were speeding. Yesterday, my husband and I witnessed a car trying to plow through a group of wild birds that were walking across the street doing 30+ mph and not slowing down. Every day and night, we witness cars speeding through. Every neighbor has screamed and yelled at speeders passing through. They do not respect the residents living on this street. It's almost a free for all. It is absolutely dangerous to walk on this street day or night. My dog and I almost got hit while walking on our street. We believe that speed tables like they have on other streets next to us would reduce the speeding on our street and will increase safety. We will try to keep videos of speeders and reckless drivers as evidence so we can build this case stronger.	Road Issue

Intersection of Countryside Blvd Northbound/Southbound, This light needs more equal time as the 580 light does, now that the Snow Birds will be arriving.

Don't need a "survey" all the bites hint to a PROBLEM !

A WO closing resolution of "I entered a service request about the mosquito problem in your area" is not a resolution, it is a step in the process. We have nooooo idea what if anything was done other than a survey which we're pretty sure didn't even threaten the mosquitos let alone kill or prevent them.

People say they have called you and you said you won't do anything about it because there is some kind of irrigation problem. Please, I implore you, reconsider, and spray thoroughly. We're dying out there. It's truly unbearable.	Mosquito Control

Missing yellow flags for the crosswalk to and from Enterprise dog park. There is only one broken flag there.	Traffic Signal Issue
The area of sidewalk on the south side of Enterprise, from east of the dog park proceeding eastward for about two blocks is severly overgrown with shrubbery and tree branches, making it dangerous for pedestrians and bike riders alike. Due to the curving nature of the sidewalk it is difficult to see what is ahead. This makes for and especially dangerous situation for handicapped individuals who may wish/need to use the sidewalk.

Traffic signal out at N Fort Harrison Ave & Sunset Point Rd	Traffic Signal Issue
Sunset Pt. Road  pedestrian ROW sidewalk construction
Reference: PID: 01886A

When the referenced project started, there was a "Local Traffic Only" sign placed at the stop light  (Sunset Pt Rd--east bound lane) which effectively discouraged pass-through traffic.  However, a couple weeks ago this sign was moved about a 100 yards to the east (in grass) of where it was originally. This modification has generated unsafe conditions for local pedestrian and vehicular traffic.	Traffic Signal Issue
Please review and adjust the signal timing for southbound Alt 19 (Edgewater Dr) at Sunset Point Rd. During morning rush, traffic routinely backs up into Dunedin (i.e., past Union St.). This morning (4/28/17) at 7:35 AM, it took three light cycles to get past this light heading southbound. Thanks!	Traffic Signal Issue

The lights at World Pkwy and N Belcher are frequently out of sync.  They will turn green twice for World Pkwy, while holding up traffic on Belcher, or hold the left turn signal green going south on Belcher when there is no one turning onto World Pkwy.  It is a frequent issue going both directions for traffic on Belcher, especially during rush hour.	Traffic Signal Issue
The traffic signal at Belcher Rd and World Parkway Blvd is horribly mis-timed. It is vitually impossible to get through this intersection when traveling north or south on Belcher without getting a red light, no matter what time of the day or night it is. With Belcher being such a heavily traveled road, this is completely absurd, since the people from On Top of the World seem to take precedence, I have seen the light stay green on Belcher for 8 total seconds before quickly turning red again, and only because a single car wanting to leave OTOTW triggered the change. This light is a major annoyance, as are the lights immediately north and south of it. The timing is completely off, and getting through them is literally impossible without having to stop. PLEASE look into this, as a 3 mile commute to work for me should not take 12-15 minutes each way, and all because of these stupid lights.	Traffic Signal Issue
Problem when on World Parkway Blvd going either East or West across Belcher.  Waiting at a red light to cross Belcher, traffic is moving North and South on Belcher on Belcher as it should.  Then Nothern bound Belcher trafiic stops while Southbound Belcher traffic can make the left turn to World Parkway.  Rather than then letting East bound traffic proceed while Northbound is stopped, Northbound traffic is allowed to start again while East bound traffic continues to wait at the red light.  It appears that East (or West) bound often sits through a red light while North bound goes though two cycles.  I hope this makes sense.	Traffic Signal Issue
I drive a scooter.  I was trying to turn left at the light.  I was the first vehicle in line to turn. The light would not turn to a green arrow because the indicator did not recognize me (too small an image).  There were about 10 vehicles behind me, it was quite a traffic jam.  I did wait for 3 rotations of the light to make sure that the light was not functioning.  Whatever method is used (a camera, etc.) is not working adequately and needs to be adjusted or the light needs to be reset to an automatic schedule to allow adequate and safe traffic movement.

The fence and bushes at this intersection make it hard to see if there is a walker or bicyclist coming to cross at the crosswalk.  They need to be adjusted for the drivers turning right at that point.	Road Issue

At the World Parkway & Belcher intersection in Clearwater:

Pedestrians have been hit at this intersection and there are many near misses. Currently, drivers leaving the West side on World Parkway get a green light at the same time as the Pedestrian crosswalk walk light is on! If drivers are turning left, to go north on Belcher, the green light is directing them to cross over the pedestrian lane at the same time the Pedestrians are being directed to use the crosswalk. If the drivers don't have their turn signal on, pedestrians can be surprised by a car suddenly turning towards them while they are in the crosswalk. Could  the Crosswalk light, and the West side traffic light, be reset so we don't have the green light on for the drivers turning left when the Pedestrian crosswalk light is on?
Can there be a 'NO turn on RED sign' on the right lane of World Parkway, leaving the East side, where one turns to go  north onto Belcher. This could prevent drivers turning without seeing pedestrians entering the crosswalk. Currently driver's don't have a clear view of pedestrians waiting to cross due to obstructions.

All four corners have this sign and driver's do not know what it means. Pedestrians crossing Belcher fear for their life crossing the road.	Traffic Sign Issue

Why are projects that require major road blockage or restriction being scheduled during the season?  This is insane.  Last year, right in the middle of the season when the tourist traffic is the worst to the beach, the main road off the beach had major construction.  this could have been scheduled to occur during off season times.  With all of the large new hotels being allowed to be built on the beach, the traffic is already increased to an unacceptable level.  Now, the entire causeway is being blocked down to one lane.  Us residents have to endure extremely bad traffic just from the influx of tourists.  Why would the city schedule items like this for this time of year.  It is absolutely stupid.

Hello, 

At 1441 Norwood Dr there is frequently a man who lets his 2 dogs off leash in the street in front of his house. The dogs are not under any control. 

On many past dates in Aug-Sep-Oct, the dogs have chased after me while I am walking my dog and do not listen when the owner tries to call them back. I thought the problem had ended as I had not seen them at large in a few months, but I was wrong. 

Last night, 12/27/2017 at approximately 5:30 PM, the dogs were out in the street again while I was walking my dogs, and an adult male and his kid were riding by on bicylces at the same time. One of the dogs from 1441 charged at the child on the bike. This morning on 12/28/2017 at approximately 7:15 AM, while on my walk with my dog again, the dogs from 1441 norwood were at large in the street. I kindly asked the owner to put them on a leash, as I know they are prone to chase my dog.

Please have someone pay him a visit to remind him of the code.	Animal Related

The two traffic lights here on McMullen Booth Rd at Enterprise Rd and Eastland Blvd need to be synced.  When one is red, the other being green only causes that intersection to become jammed.  Cars are moving slowly  already due to rush-hour traffic, and it can be hard to tell when you'll stop (thus accidentally blocking the intersection).  The lights should turn red and green at the same time to avoid this issue.  Even if one light changes to red when the other doesn't have cross traffic to warrant turning red, the cars have to stop for the first light anyway, so it should cause a worse issue.

The traffic light north/south bound in McMullen Booth is green for 4 minutes which is excessive for the traffic flow. After the first two minutes, there is little or no more traffic moving while the cross roads and turn lanes are backed up.

Intersection of Countryside Blvd Northbound/Southbound, This light needs more equal time as the 580 light does, now that the Snow Birds will be arriving. Countryside has ALWAYS been used as a shortcut, because people avoid the light at McMullen  Booth Rd to get to the Westfield Mall. I know this, because I lived at 2637 Spyglass for 14 yrs. off Countryside and  my mom has a mobile at Regency Heights off 580 (very dangerous for the elderly too) Countryside Blvd has always been busy. 
With the holidays fast approaching and Snow Birds coming, please allow equal time at this intersection light. 

Happy Holidays, thanks for all your hard work!

Sincerely,

Green Light at this intersection crossing Countryside Blvd is literally only 11 seconds.  This has been creating massive bottleneck traffic where it already exists.	Traffic Signal Issue
Sign on median nose is knocked over, at corner of Countryside Blvd and SR 580.	Traffic Signal Issue
The traffic light at Countryside and 580 is consistently mistimed. Especially in the morning and afternoon rush hours. This morning around 7:50a it let 6 cars go through before turning red again, then was red for about 3 minutes. Traffic is continuously backed up on Countryside, both ways, and it's really frustrating. The long times in between green make it seem like it's easier to just keep the lights on for so long, when it's really causing more issues.	Traffic Signal Issue

I recently requested a street light repair (light bulb out) and Duke Energy did the repair. After the repair, I noticed a city/county tree was completely blocking the light from illuminating the street (N Bayshore Blvd) making a dangerous situation for both pedestrians and motorists. I called Duke Energy to trim the tree but after several attempts, Duke Energy concluded the city/county would have to trim the tree since it was a city/county tree. Duke also advised they only trimmed trees if they were compromising power lines. 

I request your assistance to eliminate this hazardous situation. The location of the street light being blocked by this tree is 1218 N Bayshore Blvd, Clearwater, Florida. Photo provided for your review.

Hello, outside out home we are dealing with major mosquito issues. we have gotten rid of any standing water and removed over 300 bromeliad plants last month, but we are still being invaded. We go right outside our home and get at least a half dozen right to exposed areas on a non windy day. Been pulling out all the plants we can that hold water, but still cannot control them. This goes on all day long. The sides of the house and back yard are the worst.	Mosquito Control

The timing of the  traffic signal at McMullen Booth Road and Enterprise Blvd. apparently has been changed, and traffic backup is worse than ever.  The left turn signal from McMullen Booth onto Enterprise not only takes forever, but does not allow enough cars to turn.

There is a major rat issue in the Macalpine Apartment Complex/community. This issue has been going on for months. The management at this community doesn’t seem to want to do anything about it. This needs to be addressed before people start to become sick. This is a bad  infestation!!! We have even found them in the grills we cook on. As you know, they carry many diseases in which can be transferred to humans through their urine, feces, and saliva. Please, look into this matter so it can be addressed. Without your help the management team here will not take action.

There is a large ( about 6 feet by 3 feet) plastic wrapped pile of garbage, with other garbage next to and around it,  on the driveway for months. There's also a desk chair next to the tree in the front yard and a wave runner leaned with it. Trash cans and recycle bin are usually just left at the street and never brought back up to the house, making it so the wind blows their trash all over the street and other properties.  This is the only house in the neighborhood that leaves their garbage out all the time and literally pollutes our neighborhood.	Code Enforcement

Good morning. Home at 2135 Burnice Drive has quite a bit of junk built up in the front and back of the property. Grass often left to grow mid-calf/knee high in both the front and back yards, but has been more tended to in recent months. Exterior of 2135 is deteriorated and some parts of the roof/soffit have exposed openings; garage door is permanently open (might be inoperable) displaying unsightly supplies/tools/other items meant to be concealed within a garage or shed. I have observed the neighbors from 2131 Burnice confront and argue with 2135 regarding the amount of junk metal/appliances and other yard issues but I never have because I chose to overlook it, and the owner at 2135 is a nice guy. But, now I'm trying to sell my house (2143 Burnice) and the attached photo is the feedback I've received after a couple weeks on the market. Not a good feeling. At least three potential buyers specifically cited 2135 as the reason they would not offer on my property. This hurts mine, the neighborhood's, and the overall county property values. I'm sure this complaint won't help me, but I would like to be able to let the next owner know that the issue has been reported and might be addressed by someone with more 'weight' than an angry neighbor.

I live at 918 University Drive West. The house with the issue is 906.  It is not occupied and has not been occupied in a long time. The screen over the pool is not in good shape and there is water in the pool that is not clean. I believe that the property is in foreclosure.  The neighbors are discussing the mosquito problem from the pool. I hope that something can be done as the mosquitos are biting my grandchildren.	Mosquito Control
From previous WO #1957141 ->

Don't need a "survey" all the bites hint to a PROBLEM !

"Whenever possible, we try to target Mosquitoes in the aquatic, juvenile stage" please aim better.

"We are striving to improve our service" please strive harder.

A WO closing resolution of "I entered a service request about the mosquito problem in your area" is not a resolution, it is a step in the process. We have nooooo idea what if anything was done other than a survey which we're pretty sure didn't even threaten the mosquitos let alone kill or prevent them.

Thanks in advance for your effort...	Mosquito Control

One of lights in our street seems to be broken or not working properly.  Not sure if the bulb was replaced but it seems to work like a sensor light now but it wasn't like this before.

Is there any way they could fix this light and be lit the whole night.  This is a safety issue esp to the pedestrians, the light wouldn't turn on and it is very dark on our side of the road.  Thanks.

I am handicapped with chronic orthopedic and balance issues. I just closed on a new construction villa in Montclair Lakes. I was assigned a mailbox which is at the very top of the mailbox kiosk. I have a hard time reaching the  mailbox and cannot see into the mailbox unless I have a stool. I  complained to the builder but was told the post office assigned the mailboxes. I emailed the postmaster and was told that due to electronic sorting of mail, the mailbox cannot be reassigned. I also asked if the kiosk can be lowered by 12 -15 inches.  The email I received from Timothy Fay from  the postoffice stated that "The Postal service does not provide, nor install, delivery boxes in new construction. Nor do we make the determination of whether or not ADA must be met. That would be the determination of the city, county, or state building regulation/code compliance department. We only approve or disapprove of location and that Standard 4-C type boxes are installed to postal standards. It is the sole  responsibility of the builder/project manager to determine through the code compliance department whether or not they must comply with ADA regulations."  Mr. Fay  also stated "When we approved the installation of these boxes we did inquire as to whether or not the builders had to comply with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) regulations, which would require the installation of the same type of unit but in a shorter configuration. Usually only 8 or 9 slots instead of 20. We also gave them the option of installing CBU type units that only have 8 -  16 deliveries per unit and are about a foot shorter. The builders assured us that they did not have to meet the ADA standard and chose to install the present units."     I have found the builder to lie on other issues in the past ...    So my question is... does Montclair Lakes need to be in compliance with the Code compliance for ADA regulations?  Is there any recourse for me?	Code Enforcement

The timing of the traffic signals appear to have been changed along East Bay Drive. The left turn signal from eastbound East Bay to northbound Belcher is now so quick during the 4:30 - 5:30 PM time frame that only about 4 cars can get through the light so traffic is backing up.	Traffic Signal Issue
Sign not upright in median	Traffic Sign Issue
The timing of the light doesn't seem to make sense, also, there is potential of many accidents due to lack of turn arrows for traffic making a left turn on to either north or south bound.  The timing of the light allows the traffic on belcher road to go twice in a cycle before the traffic from Montclair Rd/Old Coachman get a green light. Also, when coming from Montclair Rd eastbound and turning left onto northbound Belcher, many vehicles wind up sitting in the middle of the intersection waiting until the light turns yellow to proceed with the left hand turn. The angle of the road of Old Coachman going northbound turns just before the light and drivers coming eastbound on Montclair cannot judge whether drivers coming in the opposite direction are crossing over Belcher Rd onto Montclair or turning right onto northbound Belcher.  I drive this route frequently and have had a few close calls when proceeding through this intersection.	Traffic Signal Issue

I live at 850 South Tamiami Trail and I would like to report an issue with the timing of traffic control lights near my area.
I depart the entrance/exit of Central Park II Condos each morning @ 0745.  When the light turns green, I exit my complex and proceeded north and ultimately make the westbound curve on Mound.  If I get a good jump on it and HURRY, I can make the light where mound and Washington meet.  However, in most cases, this light turns yellow/red almost as soon as I get to it (within just a few seconds of getting the green at Tamiami/Bay).  If there would be an additional 10 seconds or so of green, it would allow a better flow of traffic from the south.  
Thank you for your consideration and any improvement you can make to this situation.	Street Light
The jogging path/sidewalk along Brother Geenan Way has become overgrown, much of the weeds overcoming the plants that were intentionally planted to improve the area. 

However now it is just a bunch of weeds. I believe it is attracting rats as there is a dead rat on the sidewalk around the next the last street whose street dead ends at the sidewalk but has access. 

I think it is sad that they spent money to plant all the plants they did and now they are all dieing off because of becoming overgrown. There was one guy out there this summer but he cut some stuff back that never grew back but it was planted there to be landscape. But he chopped it so bad it has never grown back.

This problem has been reported numerous times and Joe Cascio has been out. A few years ago the storm drain was completely clogged due to the County Bldg parking lot fence side that faces Dolphin Lane. Dead palm fronds crisscrossed the storm drain and the rushing water collected other debris which totally clogged the drain. I removed what I could, throwing the debris off to the side. The water was about two feet deep at the clogged drain site. My condo complex has rainwater that drains to the street, from an in-unit atrium. The drain could easily back up into my unit.  Please cooperate by clearing dead vegetation from the side of the fence mention above. Sure wish I had thought to take a picture! BTW there is still a dead limb from IRMA hanging right outside my rear window (same location)  I actually looks like maintenance people were here maybe yesterday? but they failed to remove all the dead fronds - it would have taken 5 additional minutes to remove all. ugh!

Tamiami from Joey'Ds all the way around to the beach road is completely flooded, locking people out the Ritz-Cartlon who need to get to work. It is also hazardous to leave the property- the water comes up to your knees in the highest places.

I like to go for walks over to Siesta Key, and on the corner of Old Oak Drive and Siesta Drive have to cross from one side of the street to the other, as the sidewalk ends on the north side of Siesta Drive heading west and continues on the south side of Siesta Drive once one passes Old Oak Drive. Unfortunately there is no formal crossing there to do so safely, and with the large volume of traffic, it is a quite dangerous intersection for pedestrians. I'd like to request a formal pedestrian crossing  with proper signage and street painting, as the curbs of the side walk have even been designed for a crossing already. Attached are photos of the current situation. Thanks for considering my request, as this would greatly help making this intersection more pedestrian and bike friendly!

SR438440 -  On 4/22/18 after the rain this is what I saw when driving North on Osprey Avenue from Siesta Drive.  Each street starting at Orchid, Magnolia, Goldenrod, Oleander etc had extreme flooding (as you can see in the pictures attached) and the storm drains seemed to be completely full and not draining.  These pictures were taken about and hour after rain stopped.  In anticipation of the road being done I would certainly hope that this storm drains be cleared or investigated to find out why they aren't draining.  Osprey is 2 blocks east of the bay which should make drainage fairly uncomplicated.  I appreciate any and all help as June 1st starts hurricane season and if we get a "real" storm, we will all be flooded out of our homes and the roads will be unpassable.  Thanks for your help.

Along this stretch of 41, the street is depressed several inches below the street gutters and this depression results in the manholes being elevated relative to the street surface. We shouldn't have to run the slalom around the manholes down this busy stretch of 41.
Additionally, the elevated street gutters poses a flooding risk as water invariably pools on the roadway until the depth is sufficient for the water to runoff onto the gutters	Stormwater Issue

I live at 850 South Tamiami Trail and I would like to report an issue with the timing of traffic control lights near my area.
I depart the entrance/exit of Central Park II Condos each morning @ 0745.  When the light turns green, I exit my complex and proceeded north and ultimately make the westbound curve on Mound.  If I get a good jump on it and HURRY, I can make the light where mound and Washington meet.  However, in most cases, this light turns yellow/red almost as soon as I get to it (within just a few seconds of getting the green at Tamiami/Bay).  If there would be an additional 10 seconds or so of green, it would allow a better flow of traffic from the south.  
Thank you for your consideration and any improvement you can make to this situation.	Street Light
The jogging path/sidewalk along Brother Geenan Way has become overgrown, much of the weeds overcoming the plants that were intentionally planted to improve the area. 

However now it is just a bunch of weeds. I believe it is attracting rats as there is a dead rat on the sidewalk around the next the last street whose street dead ends at the sidewalk but has access. 

I think it is sad that they spent money to plant all the plants they did and now they are all dieing off because of becoming overgrown. There was one guy out there this summer but he cut some stuff back that never grew back but it was planted there to be landscape. But he chopped it so bad it has never grown back.  

I am disappointed that it looked so nice before but is now just weeds.	Other

6260 Lane road is empty with a swimming pool, on the property with a downed fence and a very large awning covering the driveway has collapsed and has been this way for some time.
This is unsightly and dangerous.	Code Enforcement
I have tried for months to get Frontier to fix this issue. Calls and emails have not worked. At least six months ago one of their employees unearthed this  underground access point and left it like this. There is a big hole that a small child could fall into and get hurt. They placed about twenty orange Frontier flags around it, but left the hole and dirt in the street. Maybe coming from you, they will remedy this. I have tried for months. 
Thank you!	Other

Tree down on ROW at Lane Rd and Edwards Dr. Case was logged in to Manatee County by citizen; Marguerite Perretta (941)961-5023  margu.fl@live.com  
Large tree down from storm March 19,2019 the home is on the corner of Edwards Drive and Lane:  
I live at 481 Edwards Dr. 34243.  The house is vacant to my knowledge. Due to the fact the power lines tore out during IRMA and this tree was leaning toward the home partially out of the ground. Owner was aware of situation and is doing 
nothing , it tore up my yard alone the property line. This is a huge tree that night it also pulled out the power line
and FPL did come to repair the line. Its a mess over there.	Tree Trimming/Removal

Several boards are missing from the common red fence that encloses a clearing behind Phase II units. In addition, the lock on the gate to the fence appears to have been broken.	Other
Fence needs to be repaired and secured properly. This compromises the safety of the rear of our properties on Cooper and Windsor Streets.	Other
This is my second request to get the fence on our property repaired and properly secured. Propping it up is NOT a repair and it is NOT secured. This leaves the properties on Cooper and Windsor Streets vulnerable to being easily accessed from the back of our homes out of plain view. 30+ days is more than enough time for a simple repair. I would appreciate this matter being handled beyond the automated acknowledgement of your receipt of the issue.

You may refer to the images of the fence I submitted on March 31.	Other
I have squirrels coming into my attic at 595 Cooper St and my neighbor's attic at 597 Cooper St. We share the same roof and attic space. I had Active Pest Control come out to assess the situation today and they have provided me with a quote. The squirrels are coming in from the outdoors thru the gable vents and soffit returns. Will the Ware Estates HOA reimburse me for the repairs to vents and soffits since this is a outside maintenance issue? I can provide you with the assessment and agreement from Active Pest Control. Please let me know how to proceed. Jeff Corley	Other

Please empty lots of overflowing trash cans around the football field and bleachers at Russell Field. Also remove trash strewn around the field and bleechers. This always happens after the student football games. City should mandate high school students clean up the trash and put it in the bins after each game or the next day to make them more aware of mess they make. Thanks.

All the catch basins on the Harvard Bridge (Mass Ave) appears partially obstructed with debris.	Manhole/Street Drain Issue
Mass ave bridge sidewalk is regularly poorly shoveled in the winter. This has been occurring over the past several years. It seems one pass was made with a snowplow but there is much more snow than the rest of the Cambridge sidewalks which are nicely shoveled. This is regarding the side closer to kenmore (can not speak for other side)	Icy or Unshoveled Sidewalk

Poorly plowed bike leave on Mass Ave bridge, especially on Cambridge-bound side.	Icy or Snowy Bike Lane
Everyday there’s bikers that ride on both side s on the sidewalks and there’s bike lanes right on the street on Harvard bridge in both directions I’m a walker and am furious nothing is being done about this plz enforce rules laws	Other

Not shoveled. Packed ice. 

Note that this is not a residential sidewalk. This is a city-run sidewalk just over the Mass. Ave. Bridge on the Cambridge side.	Icy or Unshoveled Sidewalk
The entire bike and pedestrian path along the river is very badly shoveled. Though this is probably DCR property, this is unsafe for many Cambridge residents!	Icy or Unshoveled Sidewalk

Giant pot hole in southbound bike lane at start of bridge.	Pothole
	Icy or Unshoveled Sidewalk
Can someone (Cambridge, DCR, anyone!!) please please mark this bike lane with green paint at Mass Ave/ Mem Drive. Drivers keep making illegal right hook turns on bikes here at an alarming rate. Increasing the visibility of the bike lane and the requirement to YIELD would go a long way to preventing crashes.

This is a perpetual issue where NOTHING has been done for years, even after the river bike path was upgraded. Thanks!	Pavement Marking Issue
There is a large hole in the roadway at the junction of the Mass Ave Bridge at the intersection with Memorial Drive. It's between the right vehicle lane and the bicycle lane at the start of the bridge. This is particularly dangerous for cyclists due to the location and size of the hole. Thanks!	Pothole

For a pedestrian trying to cross Concord Ave. southward at Smith Place, there's a push button for a walk light.

In the last several days I have, on three separate occasions, witnessed cars coming from the Watertown direction going toward Mt. Auburn St. (toward the hospital) misunderstanding the lights, and basically thinking the green lights for Gerry's Landing were for them.  This caused them to go through red lights, then to be stuck smack in the center of oncoming traffic (those cars heading from Fresh Pond Parkway onto Gerry's Landing).  Today when I was coming from Gerry's Landing Rd./Fresh Pond Parkway, heading toward Mt. Auburn St. and Watertown, the cars in both lanes at the front of the line did not understand that the green lights were for them. (They appeared to think they were green lights to go to Fresh Pond Parkway in the direction of Brattle St.)  It took many cars honking at them for them to understand the light pattern. Mercifully, no one was hit in the earlier situations, but seeing this happen repeatedly is scary, and it seems likely it will result in an accident at some point.  It seems that the lights at that intersection are not clear enough, and particularly if you are not from around here, it would be very, very easy to misconstrue which light is meant for which lane of traffic.   It seems that arrows, or some other more definite marker such as a street name to go along with the lights, would be helpful.  What I have witnessed has been really, really dangerous and it's been pretty clear that it's not something like texting or phone use, but the drivers' difficulty in understanding which lights are meant for which roads.

The walk signal for pedestrians coming from the direction of Mt Auburn Hospital walking toward Jerry's Landing Rd and crossing Mt Auburn Street overlaps the green light of cars driving on Mt Auburn St from the Watertown direction. 

Basically, the sequencing of the lights is such that a person could be halfway across the street as a car drives into them through the intersection. 

All of the signals around this intersection should probably be checked for timing, because others may be off, too.	Traffic/Pedestrian Signal Complaint

Early at 4:30 am Monday morning,  at the Cambridge Rehab & Nursing Center on Dana St., a Republic waste removal truck very loudly emptied the waste dumpster in the driveway at the nursing home.

A road divider has been constructed at the Railroad Crossing. For traffic going towards Harvard Sq. direction (South) there are two yellow lines that divide the road. Without warning the yellow lines end at a 30 inch barrier in the middle of the road. If you are driving following the yellow lines, you get hit by an obstruction in the middle of the road. The Barrier should have been painted with reflective paint. The yellow lines should have flared to define the two edges of the barrier. I was injured by this barrier. There was no need to make such a wide separator. (I understand that after no horn at RR Crossing it was good to build it to discourage people who wind their way around drop down barrier poles). This kind of design does not appear in any design book of road construction, traffic control. Please, investigate the credentials of the Engineer who gave O.K. on this construction.

This traffic signal was just put in recently at the corner of Florence St and Cummins Highway and it is causing ridiculous traffic issues!!!! We never had any traffic problems on this street before. Now, people are backed up for 30 minutes at a time, honking, yelling, and it is impossible for us to get out of our driveway or cross the street safely. When the lights were first put up they were flashing and only changed to red for pedestrian crossings and it worked really well. PLEASE help us get this back! We liked having the lights for pedestrians, but the signals are not timed well and are causing major issues involving noise, traffic, and road rage that never existed before. Please help!

There is litter along the entire length of Rowe Street (non residential side where the fence is). This is supposedly MBTA property and is an ongoing issue. Because there are no houses, pedestriands and passengers in vehicles, toss trash, bottles and other debris onto street and sidewalk, especially at night. Children walk to school every day and have to walk around broken glass, needles, ect. The empty lot along this stretch of road has years of trash and debris visible, especially during the winter without vegitation. My family and I spent 4 hours last summer picking up trash and filled 12 large green trash bags and barely made a dent in the first 200 feet from my house.

Dead rat on street. Please remove.	Roadkill / Dead Animal
There are huge rats in this neighborhood and it’s disgusting & unsanitary. Last night a very large slow moving rat was walking across my deck in the back of an enclosed fenced single family home. I have a 10 week old puppy I’m trying to potty train and these rats are the size of my dog.  This neighborhood unfortunately has a reputation, which won’t help with real estate property values- that’s for sure. The trash issues are likely the root cause.  Please pick up the trash on time for residents and please address this serious rodent issue. I’ll be writing the city commissioner about all of the above- I am afraid to take my puppy out at night here.

Comments:  The sidewalk in front of our home at 322 Pearl Street Cambridge, 02139, requires repair. One portion of the side walk is filled with tar instead of bricks and adjacent to this section some bricks are missing and the sidewalk is warped. It poses a significant problem for snow removal.

The current parking location for the food trucks on Erie Street is unsafe and remains problematic.  Handicapped access and strollers cannot pass when the food trucks are in operation.  The site is poorly managed, and the trucks have parked in no parking zones causing a safety issue, customers overflow on private property, and there is a general lack of concern for the public right of way.

Have suggested that the location be moved to parking area in front of Fort Washington Park and the Traffic and Parking Department's response was that "In an effort to honor the historic nature of the Fort Washington Park... Waverly Street in front of the park... cannot accommodate food truck parking."  

Incredibly, it is okay to honor the historic nature of the park by allowing off leash dogs to use it as a restroom.  How does this make sense. Please explain.

This location should be reconsidered as it solves the problems at the existing Erie Street location, and in nicer weather will allow use of the park by patrons.

Looking forward to reconsideration.	Other

Hello Public Works People,

I’d like to report excessive noise outside of Riverside Place in Cambridge. It sounds like a street cleaner is going by or like an airplane engine is blowing air through it. It started around 9 PM on October 6th and is still going on October 7th at 5 AM (the time of this complaint). It had kept me awake all night. I’m not exactly sure what the source of the sound is. I would really appreciate attention to this matter! If I can figure out where it’s coming from, I will follow up with more information.

Thank You,

When driving west on Milk St towards Washington St one encounters a stop light at Milk and  Washington St.   Normal vehicular traffic can only take a right hand turn on to Washington St when the light is green as it is a T intersection and left hand turns on to Washington St is prohibited.   When the traffic on Milk St has a green light a pedestrian crosswalk sign is illuminated white for pedestrians crossing Washington St at the Old South Meeting House.   This creates a conflict between the pedestrians and the cars on Milk street that are forced to make a right hand only turn.   Given this is and the fact that vehicular traffic is restricted on Washington St heading north is it possible to get this crosswalk sign and traffic lights reconfigured?   Example Washington St traffic heading north could have a blinking yellow when the intersection is theirs and the cross walk sign is illuminated white.   When Milk St traffic heading west has the intersection the crosswalk sign would be illuminated red prohibiting pedestrian cross while traffic on Milk St is forced to talk a right turn.	Traffic Signal

Street lights are out on Raymond from Bayless to Territorial.	Street Lights
The entire intersection needs to be redone as there are many potholes and they keep reforming.	Pothole

There is a pretty new community center, but one little thing needs to get fixed on the east side of the property. The sidewalk does not have a good transition to the street. When I am biking east bound I have to go down a curb to get on to Rose, and vice versa. Please replace the curb with a walkway transition to allow for easy transportation to and from the community center	Parks and Trails

potholes all along maryland from 35E all the way past Arcade close to Clarence! Just drive down the stretch going Eastbound and stop and fill up any of the ones that you can 'drop a shoe into'. Yikes. Avoid this roadway esp the Right lane at all costs.	Pothole
Seriously. Now a route that many take to avoid traffic is blocked off. How is this adding to convenience and traffic flow when all it did is divert traffic into the higher traffic flow in turn making it more dense than less.	Traffic and Road Signs
The potholes on Hawthorne Ave between Walsh St. and Weide St. are in need of repair.  Also, the potholes on Walsh St. from Maryland Ave to Johnson High School need to be repaired.  

Our neighborhood is in great need of new streets..  The potholes in our neighborhood seem to be getting larger every year.  When will new streets be scheduled for our neighborhood?

There is a Pod storage container that has been on 31st Street between 44th Ave S and 43rd Ave S. It is preventing the slow plows from clearing our street - only half the street can be plowed. snow is now banked all around it. It is next to the alley so it is making it really hard to get in and out of the alley and safely go down the street. This is a slight hill so is already hard in the snow.	Street - Snow/Ice

Our redo at Castillo Park took over 4 years, and these new amenities, 5 old green garbage cans, are strewn thru the park. We also got 2 new recycling cans. Is this a bad joke? The West Side deserves better, especially for a park named after a patriarch of our community, Thomas Cadtillo. Whose idea was it to solve the excessive trash problem of the former park with these gross green garbage (as in THEY ARE GARBAGE!) now littering our "new" sparce park? Now we have 3 picnic tables, 2 old grills, 5 benches and 2 backless benches. The West Side deserves more for adults who also use the park. The kids portion is great. I hope the water slide will be turned on more than the 3x it was on all of our last hot summer.	Parks and Trails

I live on Lassiter Summit Court and getting out of our street to go south onto Lassiter Mill Rd is dangerous at heavy traffic times. Drivers are illegally using the double yellow lined median to get up to the left turn lane onto Currituck. When cars are backed up in the "going straight" lane, we can't see traffic jumping into the "not a turn lane" lane to get up to their left turn.  This has caused at least one wreck which luckily did not injure anyone but it could potentially be bad. Could a curb be put in to protect that median space and help with this problem? Or some other solution?

For a few days, we've experienced drainage issues.  Anytime we flush our toilet, run the dishwasher, or take a shower, there's a spewing of water from the drainage pipe in the backyard.  I've talked to other neighbors who have experienced similar occurrences making me wonder if there's a Wake County, not an individual dwelling, issue.  

I've shoveled a drainage spill-off area near the drainage pipe, but the area surrounding the pipe becomes more and more saturated with water.  I've removed water by hand three different times today and fear the water will soon reach the house.  

My neighbor's cap blew off of his drain today and I'm afraid that others will experience similar issues if this isn't addressed in the near future.

I need to know who to contact to have the speed limit on Eagles Landing Drive reduced to 25mph.  Also would like speed bumps and other traffic calming measures.

I need signatures to give to the city to 
1. Reduce the speed limit to 25mph
2. Install speed bumps.
3. Any other street that are not in the current Cardinal Grove Blvd. traffic calming project should also feel free to let me know. The whole subdivision should be 25mph and have traffic calming devices like speed bumps etc. Not just Cardinal grove Blvd.

I live on Eagles Landing Drive. I am tired of cars cutting through from Kyle Drive to Cardinal Grove Blvd at speeds way over the 35mph speed limit. I think 35mph is too high for Eagles Landing Drive in the first place. Cardinal Grove Blvd.'s speed limit is only 25mph and the road is much wider (same subdivision).  Cardinal Grove Blvd. is getting speed bumps and it looks like there will also be a median at the entrance (by the white wall at the top of CGB) to slow traffic entering the road. I want want the same for Eagles Landing Drive. I want a 25mph max speed limit and traffic calming speed bumps on Eagles Landing.  Eagles Landing is a main entrance/egress street for Cardinal Grove subdivision. It cuts through from Kyle Drive to Cardinal Grove Blvd. I regularly see cars accelerating up and down the street at what is certainly way more than the current 35mph speed limit. I have actually seen (on more than one occasion) cars come down the hill (from Kyle Drive in the direction of Cadinal Grove Blvd.) so fast that they were unable to stop at the intersection of ELD and CGB and ended up plowing straight through to the cul-de-sac at the swimming pool. It's time for this madness to stop.

From what I can make out, Cardinal Grove was made a 25mph speed zone in 2002, and yet only the main road through Cardinal Grove subdivision is sign posted as 25mph, the other roads having no signage at all.  I am tired of having cars flying by at 50mph in an area where they should be doing 25mph at most.	Signals / Signs

The cable from the cable box on my side yard has not been buried.
At the moment it goes from the cable box, across the sidewalk, across the entrance to my driveway, along the gutter for three houses, then back across the sidewalk.  Also there is a main cable box just across the street.  There is also cable running from that up the lampost on the corner overhead to a tree (that they have used as a utility pole), down the tree across the yard into the road and up the street 3 or 4 houses to connect with another cable box.  It has been like that for at least a month now.  The cable boxes have been left open with exposed electrical wire sticking out of them.  This presents several different opportunities to cause an accident, pedestrians tripping over the cables, 2 wheeled vehicles (mopeds, scooters, motorcycles) slipping on them, and the risk of electrical shock for anyone unfortunate enough to touch the exposed wires.

The speed bumps are placed to close together and cause damage to my car. Every day I traverse these I'll conceived attempts at traffic control twice. I have had to replace my tires more frequently as well as an axle for my car since thier installation. I have a 2012 Volkswagen Passat that is well maintained. 

The speed bumps decrease my gas milage, increase greenhouse gasses. When people don't see them they cause more accidents and near misses when they slam on the brakes to avoid tearing thier car up. 

If people are concerned about cars speeding through and possibly hitting pedestrians, why not provide a place on the side of the road for pedestrians to walk, perhaps a sidewalk. FYI there is a sidewalk on both sides, invest in giving people knowledge about how pedestrians belong on the sidewalk and cars belong on the road.

The bus stop sign for buses stopping on the west side of 14th & N is incorrect. It says route numbers that are the opposite of what the sign on the actual bus says. An example is that it say route 53 stops there, which is correct technically, but the sign on the bus says 41 Havelock when it arrives at this location since it is changing to that route at the next stop (Golds). This is misleading to many people and I see people get on the wrong bus because of it. StarTran management assumes that seasoned riders know this, however the system should be running in a way that a person who has never ridden can figure out what bus to catch and not worry about catching the wrong one. The 14th & N Stop is only one example. All the downtown bus stops are this way where the bus stop sign says the opposite of what the bus header sign says if it is interlining to another route at the Gold's building.	LTU General

I want to report dangerous aggressive driving I witnessed at about 5:00pm on Sunday, March 24, 2019.  A semi driver was speeding, and the driver tailgated and harassed drivers of vehicles directly ahead of the semi.  The red semi cab had "Landmark" truck lines on the door.  The Illinois license plate on the empty flatbed trailer was T517068.  
   
My husband was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  We had been westbound on I-80 and took the exit to southbound 77 bypass / Homestead Expressway.  We were in the left hand lane, behind a vehicle pulling a trailer that had "Caution  Horses" on the back (trailer license plate 3-X3110, might have been Montana).  Quite a few vehicles entered from eastbound I-80, making it too congested to move over to the right hand lane.  We did eventually move to the right hand lane, and the vehicle with the horse trailer remained in the left hand lane.  
  
A red semi with an empty flat bed trailer came up quite fast on our left, clearly speeding, and quickly moved dangerously close to the horse trailer.  While aggressively tailgating the horse trailer, the semi truck driver began honking.  The horse trailer vehicle moved over to the right when it was possible, and then the semi driver cut in immediately in front of the horse trailer vehicle so it also was in the right-hand lane.  The semi took the Van Dorn exit, which we did as well, and the horse trailer continued on 77.  There were many vehicles, and all stopped at the light before moving onto Van Dorn.  
   
Once moving eastbound along Van Dorn, we approached a red light at the intersection of  Van Dorn and S. 9th Street.  We were in the left hand lane behind multiple vehicles.  The semi driver came up behind several cars (at least four) in the right-hand lane right hand lane, and although the cars were moving to turn right onto S. 9th, the semi driver pulled very close behind the car directly in front of his vehicle and began honking again.  All of them made their right turn onto S. 9th and we continued east on Van Dorn.  
  
I have a digital movie of the approach to the intersection of Van Dorn & 9th.  I was able to start it in time to include the semi honking at the cars in front.  I did not get my camera out in time to film the aggression toward the horse trailer vehicle, but I do have a picture of the semi and the trailer's license plate.	Police – Speeding Vehicle

Our road is super icy, and I'm afraid to even drive on it because I'm scared we will pop a tire!  It is not draining well at all.  We don't get much traffic on this street because basically the only people that drive on it are people who live on our street because it is a "C" shaped street and nobody cuts through using it except us who live on it.  The drainage is bad and the water can't get to the storm drain easily so the melted snow is just backing up on the road.  If we could just get a plow to come through when it is slushy today (Sunday) or tomorrow (Monday), that would be so helpful!	Icy Street

I also ride & don't want to meet the pavement trying to get to my driveway.  Please repair this section of Mulder Dr. so that it lasts.  Thank you.	Pothole

Two sump pumps, from the same house, are being discharged into the street. One out of the curb, one out of a hose. In the winter this creates a huge icy intersection where it is an inconvenience for pedestrians. For cars, such huge ice potholes form, you can bottom out your car on them. This street was just redone along with many portions of the sidewalk, I was hoping the sump pump line under the walk would be removed.	Icy Street

A City maintainer and truck came by which is great after this last snow but did not plow curb to curb, like they did twice before this year and have for many years. No cars were on the street but they did not plow to the west curb as they did the east side. Now the Post Office since us a card telling us they need it plowed so they can deliver mail. Can you see that this is done as it has always been done.

Hello. I live in the Porter Ridge neighborhood and the lights heading into the neighborhood (Porter Ridge Rd) were recently updated on 27th Street. The lights now include a turn light but the turn light is never green. We turn left (east) onto Porter Ridge Rd every night between 5:30 and 6. The traffic is very heavy, and between the hill that traffic comes over heading north, people trying to turn west, and the right turn lane for the northbound traffic, that left turn can be tough and quite a blind spot at heavy traffic times. My question/concern is that there is now a left turn light, but it is never green. It would be very beneficial if it would at least work during the peak hours in the mornings and evenings during the week. Please take this into consideration.

We were heading north on 70th St. wanting to turn east on Highway two which there is no turn lane and the red light was there forever and ever and ever and ever. Since there was no turn lane we couldn't turn right had to wait for the car ahead of us, but the light was so long, too long.	Traffic Signal Concern / Signal Burned Out
Southbound 70th St lane closure measures approaching Hwy would benefit from safety improvements. The Left-land closed sign is obscured by a tree, and the cones themselves appear abruptly as you make the bend, risking mid-speed, last-minute merges. It would be far safer to begin the lane closure further north, before the bend, where visibility is high.	LTU General

This vehicle has been parked on the street since January 1st. It has been reported 2 times as of this report. The vehicle has not been marked by police or parking authority that I am aware of. My concern is how does the city know if this vehicle has been a part of a serious crime or a missing person if they do not come and investigate the vehicle? Another concern is that the street is very narrow and if a car is parked on the other side of the street, it makes it difficult for construction or garbage trucks to pass through and could cause damage to vehicles or injury to drivers. Also, when another car is parked directly across the street or within a few car lengths east or west of this vehicle across the street, it causes a bottleneck and the through traffic backs up. The vehicle is an older maroon Buick with 34 county plates and is parted across the street of 1208 Starview Lane.	Parking - For over 24 Hours on City Street

All of the residential streets around 11th & Washington, 1441 S 11th St. are full on ice sheets. Please please please do something to remedy this situation, this winter has been mild for a while but then hit hard, so you can't use the excuse that you don't have the equipment or man power to treat the 3,000 miles of our roads because you have not had to do that much work in the first place.  You have done a great job on the major streets, but then you quit! What are you doing? In the time that you spent whining saying you can't do anything else, you could have been working on our streets one at a time and probably could have been done by now.  So what have you  been doing with our tax money?  Please get off your butts and do your jobs.  Thank you ever so much.	Icy Street

I am contacting you today to let you know that the mud run off has not been cleared from the sidewalk and has been a consistent nuisance and slip hazard since my original post. Attached is a picture from my security camera showing the mud remaining in the sidewalk. Thank you in advance for your work to improve this area of sidewalk that is utilized by many. 

Original Issue 4905984: Attached is an updated picture of the dirt/mud run off from property at 2913 S 48th St. The recent rains have caused this run off and a hazard on the sidewalk. Many people use this sidewalk to get to jobs and shopping.	Mud in Street Due to Construction

22nd and Vine. North lane of westbound traffic	Pothole
The ladies two doors down from me park within five feet of a residential curb cut approximately 7 days a week. They've been my neighbors for 20 years, and in that span of time I've told them about 20 times that they are parked illegally. I've told them that if their vehicles are hit while illegally parked, their insurance companies will likely assign them 50 percent responsibility because they are illegally parked. Nothing I say makes a difference. Every day, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., at least one of them is going to be parked at the edge of the curb cut. Worst offender: White Chrysler 200, plate No. VCB 225. Wednesday night, I went out to leave and it was actually parked across the driveway. Tonight, it's in its typical position, 3 inches from the curb cut. They don't seem to understand that I talk to them about their illegal parking because I don't want to hit their cars in this very crowded section of the 2400 block of U Street. We have 12 cars parked perpendicular to the street in a lot that requires us to back out onto U Street. It's hard to do with when they are parked so close to the driveway, especially with so much snow and ice on the ground and piled up everywhere. Please help.	Parking - In City Right of Way

The property at 631 N 24 is a problem property. There are people living there who are not owners or tenants. They have broken the windows and are in the front lawn 24/7 screaming and yelling. There is no water or electricity. They readily admit that they intend to trash the property so that they can buy it cheap. It was just purchased by a company not locate in Lincoln and they have never been to the property. All of the windows are open so that the rain can readily go into the house. The property has been reported to the police by numerous people on numerous occasions. The police acknowledge that they are there illegally but appear not to be able to do anything.. One of them took a car and ran over lawns and fences. The tenant in a nearby property moved because of fear of them. Given the health and safety status of the house and the illegal squatters, it isn't clear to anyone who something can't be done.	Mayor - Ombudsman

In addition, cars on Erie speed very fast and cannot slow in time. I have witnessed in person at least 7 accidents there over the last year since we moved to the street.

The Monaco, located at 465 Washington Blvd, Jersey City, NJ is a 50 story building with 2 towers.

Many of the building’s residents, and I expect transient residents, come from varied ethnic backgrounds and countries.

My husband and I moved to the area one month ago and in that time have narrowly avoided getting hit by cars (by jumping out of the way or sprinting across the road) in the crosswalk (which we used the signal for) between Bramhall Ave and Berry Lane Park crossing Garfield Ave, at least 15 times EACH. On average we have to wait 4-6 minutes to cross the street because, even with the crosswalk signs blinking, cars and even municipal buses continue to speed past. Today a car actually sped up towards my husband and our dog while they were crossing in the crosswalk, as if to purposefully hit them, and then yelled out the window "go back to Hoboken white boy". I also walk pass this crosswalk and the one at Union St. and Garfield Ave every day to and from the light rail and have seen at least 10 other people experience this danger, including just yesterday a mom with two kids walking back from football practice in the park. The car just barely skidded to a stop in time to avoid hitting the three people when they had clearly waited for the crosswalk lights to start blinking and looked for signs of oncoming cars. The problem seems to be that drivers, again including municipal buses, feel no need to regard crosswalk laws and also that they tend to speed on Garfield so it is nearly impossible for them to stop in time at either crosswalk. We are from Atlanta and are no stranger to this issue. After several people were hit by cars one summer police started sitting at the crosswalks and ticketing people who did not stop for pedestrians. The city also installed speed bumps before the most dangerous crosswalks to ensure drivers had to slow down in time to see the crosswalk lights. Both of these tactics worked very well. We already love so much about Jersey City and are very happy to be living where we do, right near the park and in a more residential area of the city, but after a month of feeling panic when I try to legally cross the street, and of constant worry for my husband and our dog when they are out walking, not to mention the many strangers I have seen narrowly avoid cars while using the crosswalks, I implore the city to do something more to help make this street much safer. Thank you so much!	Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Study Requests

Newark Street might be a short stretch of road, but it has been in horrible shape for years. It's a very common thoroughfare to/from 280 to Rutgers Medical & Dental School, NJIT, and Rutgers Newark. 

Every time a pothole is patched it just adds to the problem because they shovel on asphalt and don't bother tamping it down. In it's current state, it's a mess of constant of bumps and potholes, much like a dirt road. At the very least, it needs to be repaved from Orange St. to Central Ave.

Seeing how this street is the city's namesake, I would expect the City of Newark to take better care of it... Especially since one of your municipal gas stations is on this road. It's not only destroying my suspension, it is also destroying the suspensions of city vehicles. 

Please consider repaving the problem areas of this street.	Other

Homeless woman and her dog, concerned for their safety, they have been out in the cold for over 2 weeks, the dog is a large Doberman, I was able to get them some food and a dog coat, at this point the dog doesn't have a choice about being outdoors, the police came and tried to get her to go to shelter but she won't, dog doesn't have that option. At this point she is not providing proper care for her dog, food, shelter, water. There are laws in NM that state you must provide proper food, shelter and water for your pet. She is putting herself and her dog at risk again she does have a choice to get to a shelter her dog does not. With the impending storm I would hope that animal welfare can go out and pick this dog up. They are located on the west side of tramway/Rover hunkered down in some cedar pines on the side of the bridge that faces the mountains.

Bicyclists consistently enter and exit the Bosque Bike path on the south side of the west end of Campbell Road at the entrance to Alejandro Lane NW.  Because of the gates, trees, and bike path barriers, bicyclists cannot see the Alejandro Lane residents' vehicles exiting Alejandro Lane. There have been numerous near misses of late and the situation is getting worse.  The residents have trimmed the trees and bushes and installed mirrors  to improve visibility to see bikers, but the bikers don't seem to know that there are cars coming out the gate to be aware of.  So, either the entrance to the bike path needs to be moved or signs identifying that there is a hidden entrance to Alejandro Lane need to be installed - or both.  This is a dangerous situation for bicyclists. Since this is a main entrance to the Bosque Bike path, this needs to be addressed.	Other

There are several recycling dumpsters behind the Smith's grocery store on Golf Course and Paseo.  This morning I was putting glass into the bin for glass and then went over to one of the large recycling containers for cardboard etc.  There were already people going through one of the other bins so I went to another one and lived to  lid to find a man in there!  It scared the ** out of me.  There are more and more homeless back there who are rather scary.  This neighborhood didn't used to have homeless people living there but there seem to be more and more.  There isn't a shelter in the area that I know of, I suppose the man may have gone in there to get out of the rain last night, but it was frightening to open the bin and see him in there.  It is also dangerous for him, the trash trucks often come on Sunday morning to empty the bins and someone could get hurt.  Could the police maybe check this area periodically?  Thank you.	Other

Lanes through the intersection are completely faded.  Heavy traffic at rush hours and multiple vehicles are cutting into parallel turning lane.  Please continue lane division from north eagle ranch to west bound paradise.	Traffic Pavement Markings
Getting on to Paseo in the morning during rush hour is of course madness, however turning south from Paradise on to Eagle Ranch many people use the Straight Lane opposed to the turning lane for quicker access and does cause delay for other vehicles and I have seen several cars and drivers being aggressive, in an attempt to get in 'line' sooner as well as very close accidents occurring because of cars turning illegally to avoid staying in the appropriate lane. I access Paseo everyday and I have seen this happen everyday and I finally got frustrated today and needed to email because of the aggressive drivers and because of people utilizing this aspect as a turning lane when it is not causing other drivers to swerve and get more aggressive.  I just feel like something needs to be done if either a sign can be put up indicating no turn or some kind of barrier to indicate no turn but it's just ridiculous.	Other

Adjusting the synchronization of this traffic light could make traffic flow more smoothly.   For the MORNING commute, if the left turn arrow for traffic turning FROM Eagle Ranch Rd onto Paradise activated AFTER the traffic going straight ahead on Eagle Ranch Rd towards PDN, then it would be much more equitable in terms of whose ‘turn’ it is.  Right now, while that left turn is active, all of the traffic turning right onto Eagle Ranch from Paradise gets in first (in the gap) and when it’s Eagle Ranch’s turn, there is no space left so the intersection gets blocked and only about 3 cars get through the intersection during the traffic light cycle.  

It would be really helpful if someone could come study the traffic and adjust the traffic light (left turn activation).	Other

My issue with my back fence weed and dried foilage had been addressed by the city and took action immidiately! I would like to thank the persons involved in resolving my concern relating to the potential Fire Hazzard! I'm also sending this message to ask a few questions. I plan on putting a 4x4 by 4 feet width boundary from my back fence to the arroyo, and will place a tarp material to prevent weeds from growing back, that would result in the same concerns. The small tarp area perimeter will be covered with gravel. My initiative evolves around the idea of preventing weeds to come right back up and eventually go trough the same process probably on a yearly basis, which will cost the city monetary expense related to manpower wages. My idea not only protects my interest, it will also help the city in decreasing expenditures relating to weed clean up, but also this simple solution in which I'm willing to spend money on will aid in the cleanliness and beautification of the area. I would like to know the legality of my plan to prevent the issue from arising again. I had found a contractor who is willing to assist me by providing Thier services which I will pay for. They are set on doing the project on August 8, 2016. The only problem is, my party needs to get some kind of approval from the appropriate department within the city government. We also need a confirmation notice regarding the area beautification project and informations on how the contractor could access an entry/exit points to be able to unload the material on my back fence area, adjacent to the arroyo. This matter is extremely important, as the projected start is fast approaching. With this message I do expect dissemination of this inquiry to appropriate channel and point of contact and I should receive the information requested in order to avoid any violations for my attempt to prevent, beautify the area of concern. This will also allow my hired contractor the information needed to get to the area by accessing the arroyo access points and have the assurance from the city in complying with regulations pertaining to the matter. My address is 4316 Loren Ave. NW, Albuquerque, NM 87114. You may contact me at 505-933-2947 or email me at Xavier.scott1969@gmail.com. I thank you in advance for assisting me with this matter and I hope that you provide me with time and effort in my goals to assist our community with this project. Sincerely, Xavier Scott!	Other

This neighbor was told by the state that she needed to appropriately dump her asbestos tiles/linoleum (after a kitchen remodel) with an approved/certified asbestos removal service. She had been storing the tiles/linoleum on the side of her house. She was also told to throw away the foam padding, not to store it. All she's done is move the linoleum and foam padding to her backyard where no one can see it from the street. The foam has been rained on and is starting to mold and the stench is coming through our bedroom window. The linoleum has gotten soaked and then bakes in the sun and is starting to crack and fall apart, creating potentially hazardous dust. She had her yard man take the asbestos tiles away.	Other
This neighbor is a hoarder. Her house and garage are filled wall-to-wall with trash and are becoming a fire hazard (not to mention the roach problems that has arisen because of all the books and paper stored in her garage). 

Now she has begun storing her trash OUTSIDE of her house. She had her kitchen remodeled in July and, without our consent or knowledge, used our trash bins while we were on vacation to dump the leftover construction materials (the "contractor" she hired said disposal of the debris from the remodel was her responsibility), including linoleum flooring and asbestos tiles (see photo attached), into the city landfill. We caught her on our security cameras taking our trash bin while we were out of town then she told us that she used them to dump these materials. Now she has asbestos tiles and linoleum sitting outside her house. We cannot use our side yard or open our 9-year-old daughter's bedroom window because we are worried about the asbestos materials and other toxic debris getting into her room.

We want all of the trash removed AND DISPOSED OF PROPERLY (NOT just stored/hoarded in her back yard or house with the rest of her trash). We have talked to her about this issue and we have written her two letters asking her as much and she has not complied.	Weed & Litter Complaint

Luckily were were about 100 feet away providing me time to grab a branch and fling it towards the charging dog. I also hollered at it to "Go Home" and "get" Thankfully the dog backed off and we were able to walk away unhurt. If I had been a child walking my dog this situation could have ended badly. Thanks	Aggressive Dog

This is the third time I have reported this issue. This alley, which runs north-south between 14th and 15th streets NW, has been used for illegal dumping for several years.

Just refreshing my request of two months ago -  case #180507-000029 - regarding the cycle track on Rancho Seco between Central and Lomas.

I was almost hit by a car yesterday turning right from EB Lomas to SB Rancho Seco. I was riding a bicycle NB on the new "cycle track" bike lane created to divert bikes off of Central. The new lanes put bikes on the left side of Rancho Seco, heading north, directly in the path of oncoming traffic turning right off of Lomas. There are no signs on Lomas to warn cars of the non-standard configuration, so people circling around to get into the Wendy's end up driving the wrong way down the bike lane with no signs to warn them not to.

Drainage bridge.  There is an opening for drainage into the Black Arroyo which has a "bridge."  The concrete which the bridge sits on is starting to decay which promotes a tripping hazard when walking on it.  This bridge does not have hand rails to hang onto which makes it even more dangerous if a person trips over the crumbling concrete and has nothing to hold onto to break the fall.  A person will take a pretty good fall to the concrete below if this happens.  It also proposes an falling hazard to the concrete below when little kids are riding their bikes and happen to veer off the bridge.  I couldn't find where else to report this issue so I am hoping whomever reads this will submit it to the correct office.  Thank you.	Graffiti

Some years back the city installed a gate in the alley at the nw corner of G'OKeeffe park.  It was intended to discourage unwanted activity behind the 21 homes that back to the alley.  The ARENA neighborhood association installed a lockbox allowing those homeowners access when needed.  More recently the city installed their own lock telling homeowners to call 311 if they needed access.  That lock however has been removed by a homeowner and replaced with a combination lock prohibiting access by the city or neighbors.  This homeowner stores a camper behind one of the homes, contrary to neighborhood covenants, and does not live in the home where it is stored.  The city needs to remove this lock and replace it with one of its own.  Alley is at the intersection of Academy Ridge Rd. and Academy Ridge Dr. NE.'	Other

I can’t pinpoint the exact location of where this road debris is coming from but..We live near Edith & Candelaria (on Franciscan St. NE) We travel near Edith & Candelaria, and up to Comanche often. We also use i25 North and South (from Comanche to the Sunport exit and back). There is so much construction material on i25 in particular that I’ve noticed recently. We both had new tires put on in the last year (my husband’s were put on just a week ago). Although I do understand that things like this happen, it is a bit ridiculous that we’ve had 3 INCIDENTS in 1 WEEK. Hopefully someone else or multiple people can help pinpoint the problem areas so that a street sweeper can help prevent more expensive repairs, and dangerous, debris littered roads.	Other

Good morning,  There is a non-compliance with zoning hearing examiner decision from Project # 1011333 Dated decision 11-01-17.  The applicant A Murray of 8500 Rancho Mirage Ne 87113 was denied a variance for existing sheds in setback.  He has moved the shed into the rear setback without any permit or variance, in violation of the hearing order and the zoning code,  will you please have a code enforcement officer inspect and get them to comply with the order by Christopher Graeser.  I appears the owner is attempting to run electric? to the shed in the dug trench without any permits.

Also, the homeowner has replaced the swamp cooler with refrigerated air and did so without permits and there are wires hanging under the unit on the roof, it appears to be a safety/fire hazzard.  Please send a code enforcement officer out to inspect and force compliance with the code for electric.

There is a vintage Ford Mustang parked on a city street for many weeks now. It is parked on the east side of the street between 7112 and 7108 Ticonderoga Road NE, just north of the Heritage Hills City park. 

Ticonderoga Road NE is not a free public parking lot. I believe this car belongs to 7108, since I have seen it parked there much earlier. This car needs to have a current license plate, insurance, and vehicle registration.

The vehicle is covered and is hard to describe. It has a gray colored sun cover, completely obscuring the vehicle. Can't get the license plate number because the cover is on too tightly.

You will need an industrial sized wood chipper to clean up the downed trees on the east and west sides of Tramway between Comanche and Montgomery.

On the east side of Tramway between Comanche and Montgomery somebody clear cut all the trees adjacent to the wall bordering the Alta Vista Apartments just north of the arroyo which crosses under Tramway. I’ve been waiting for the same somebody to clean up the downed trees but I think I’ll waiting a long time. If the city could come out and clean up the mess left behind that would be greatly appreciated. Also, while you’re out there with your wood chipper, there’s a pile of dead bushes just south of the arroyo that the guys laying fiber optic lines left behind. If you could clean that up too, that would also be greatly appreciated.  

On the west of Tramway between Comanche and Montgomery just north of the arroyo which crosses under Tramway, a dead tree was recently blown over and is now blocking the foot path. If you take care of that, that would be greatly appreciated. And just north of that dead tree, there are large branches left over from the last dead tree that was blown over. If you could clean that up too, that would also be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

On Tuesday 08/12/14 I was waiting for the Montgomery bus at Montgomery and Spanish Bit. The bus is due at 6:45 a.m., and if late it is impossible to transfer to the San Mateo bus when it comes at 7:05 (NB). The #5 bus was not only late, it was very late, and did not arrive until 6:55 (10 minutes late). This made me 30  minutes late for work, and I lost half an hour's pay because of it. Why can't RJ Berry and the Transit department make the buses run on time?	Other

At Alta Vista apartments at 4200 Spanish Bit NE, there have been some major tenant nuisance issues that the office manager is ignoring. In A101, there's a single mom with dogs that she neglects in the apt where it is constantly barking and using the bathroom in the apt. The single mom's children are also abused and neglected, being left outside to use the bathroom outside. In A209, a man who has set his apt on fire, pulled a knife on another tenant among other threatening acts the office manager is doing nothing about. Lastly A304 is harassing and stalking his next door neighbor in A303 by trying to chase her out of her apt. She's lived there for almost 7 years, he's not been there for six months. The apt office manager has been told in person, in phone calls and emails repeatedly but will not do anything	Other

My name is Randy Harrison and I'm writing to report a very unsafe driver of an Albuquerque bus.  This driver was operating bus #704, license plate number G72112, and was driving route 157.  This afternoon my wife and I were traveling west bound on Ellison and this bus abruptly changed lanes into us requiring me swerve to the left to avoid our vehicle being hit by the bus.  It appeared to us that the driver just changed lanes into our lane without checking for clearance and did not see our vehicle.  The collision would have been very serious and our vehicle would have been badly damaged.  I believe this driver should be punished or fired for his reckless driving.  I am just thankful we avoided a collision.  If anyone cares to contact me about this incident my daytime phone number is 505-844-4830 and mobile number is 505-401-9102.

I am reaching out to you on behalf of an HOA (homeowner’s association) that we manage called Estates at Desert Ridge Trails. 

Estates at Desert Ridge Trails HOA would like to know what the possibility of putting stop signs before and after the entrance to Estates at Desert Ridge Trails is. This would be in place of requesting speed humps be installed by the city, which we know is an impossibly hard thing to get approved. 

What, exactly, is the process that’s required by the city to place stop signs at the locations hazardous to the public? Children catch the school bus there every weekday morning, and then children are dropped off every weekday afternoon on Florence, which has become a speedway. In addition to school buses, there are vehicles pulling out onto Florence and also turning into Estates at Desert Ridge Trails over 10,000 times a month. All these cars, vans, and trucks have to watch out for speeding cars going up to 60 MPH or more. With these hazards, there is bound to be an accident without some way of controlling the speed of the traffic, which uses Florence as a thoroughfare every day. They are keeping this in mind when they know that a child was hit and killed up east of the HOA on Florence, where the elementary school is located. 

Would you be able to inform us as to what the process is to get stop signs placed before and after the entrance into this HOA? If you do not have this information, would you be able to direct me to someone who would be able to assist with this request? We would greatly appreciate any information and feedback you may have. Thank you!	Other

I live at 1908 1/2 Lead SE.  Pulling out of my driveway to get onto Lead Ave at that location is a life threatening event.  That part of Lead has curbside parking on both the north and south side of the street.  To park on the north side of Lead in that area requires a permit, but no permit is required to park on the south side of Lead.  Guess what that means.  That means  UNM students, CNM students, and even the people who live in the apartments on the north side of Lead and can't find a parking space on their side of the street park there.  Between the cars right up to the edge of the driveway, coupled with the various layers of landscaping, it is virtually impossible to gauge oncoming traffic.  I would love for someone to come out and actually take a look at this situation.  Better yet, come and get in the passenger side of my car and we'll merge into traffic during rush hour.  I think it would only take one such experience to grasp just how the poor visibility created by the cars and landscaping make that a risky proposition.	Other

I am writing this email concerning a PITBULL that resides at 6314 Gonzales Rd. SW.  The dog is unattended, not contained, unleashed, and consistently left to wonder Gonzales Road.  My fear if approached the dog may possibly bite anyone that is not familiar with the dog such as a child.  Our neighborhood has had many problems with stray dogs and lack of restraining the animal to the point that a pitbull jumped into my backyard such as that at  6314 and mauled my pet. I live at 6312 and currently do not "OWN" any pets.	Other

Corner of sandalwood place and cherry hills road. Every year we turn him in. He moves a few pinecones...we've watched this. I asked him if he eould cut something back. He screamed at me. Came at me in the middle of the street.He is frightening. Something must be done! 6912 sandalwood place. This couple does nothing to maintain their property. Weeds and dead juniper bushes. Cherry hills subdivision was built in 1980. It was heavily overplanted. In a city so concerned about water use/shortage, it seems time to require residents to get rid of overgrowth. The city could give incentives to property owners to clean up this once beautiful neighborhood. It is a prime location that is steadily going downhill in regard to maintaining property.

The Columbus park tennis backboard is a problem. Tonight at 8:55 there were individuals kicking a soccer ball and throwing a basketball against the backboard, which is extremely loud and disruptive. Also people are urinating, defecating, and using drugs behind the backboard, using it as a public shield but in direct line of sight of our home (directly north of the backboard). 

Parks and Recreation officials have acknowledged that the backboard is a problem (and that it needs to be removed or relocated) but nothing is being done.

I called 311 this morning regarding this issue: Our HOA ( Oxbow park HOA) owns a private park in our community. We would like consideration for a waiver to the city's dog leash ordinance so that we can implement unleashed dog requirements for our private park. We recognize that there are several city parks that have been designated as unleashed dog parks ( e,g, Roosevelt Park). I was directed to animal welfare who call me back shortly after my request ( I so appreciate the immediate feedback) , however they indicated that we would need to direct our request to the Mayor's office. I'm wondering who the contact person would be to help us with this process. Thank you for your consideration.   Cindy Churan	Other

I arrived home last evening to find my neighbor's yard man parked in front of my house, looking up at the branches of the large Modesto Ash on my property.  He said that his client, Mr. Sameer Hemmady, my neighbor at 6312 Puma NE, is wanting to trim the branches of my tree to improve the reception of his satellite dish.  This is the 2nd time Mr. Hemmady has requested that I remove branches from this majestic tree.  The first time was to give his yard more sunlight to encourage more lawn growth.  I did so by hiring Baca Trees, at no small expense to me, and had the tree professionally pruned.  (Mr. Hemmady has since removed the grass from his back yard.)  I told his yard man to have Mr. Hemmady come talk to me directly about the matter. When he does, I would like to be prepared with an opinion from the City as to whether I am required to honor such a request.  My inclination is to suggest that Mr. Hemmady move his satellite dish to an unobstructed, southern-facing location, which is clearly an option.  The tree has been there for 27 years, about 20 years longer than the Hemmadys' have owned the home.  I don't wish to be unneighborly, but I don't see how his satellite problem requires any action on my part.  The City's opinion?  Thank you,

This homeowner does not and as far as I can tell has never cleaned up feces after their dog. While it is in their yard, it is excessive to the point where it smells and is clearly a problem for neighbors in the area. I remember reading an article in KRQE about a city ordinance about picking up after yours dogs even in your own yard.

These are townhomes. So they are close together with small yards. It is unacceptable and impacting the quality of life and ability to enjoy neighboring yard space as well as endangering our precious water supplies (we have yard drains that go directly to the arroyo between I-40 and to the river)	Other

Terrible bus service. The 140 Southbound (San Mateo) was due at Osuna and Jefferson at 5:26 p.m. It arrived at 5:44 p.m. Just before Montgomery, I rang the bell to request next stop. The driver blew by the next stop (San Mateo and Montgomery) even though there were people waving at him. I finally got him to stop at the stop after that. I asked him why he didn't stop at the stop I had requested, and he shrugged his shoulders and said there was a bus behind him (so?!). I ran to catch the #5 eastbound, but missed it, which put me half an hour late home. Last week a late, inattentive driver made me late for work; this time one made me late home. What would it take to make the buses run on time? I don't know, but neither does ABQ Ride, and that's the problem.	Other

We don't have containers yet. But my recycling has not been picked up for months.  And because our condo's are so close together we do not have 5 feet between containers.  I've tried placing the bag in red zones where there was plenty of room but they still will not pick them up.  Our condo's will not receive our containers for many more months yet but I've got quite a bit of recycling and I know others do as well.  Why have the trucks stopped picking up our recycling?  In the pictures included you can see that each condo has 3 garages, meaning 3 people (cans) and there are 4 buildings on this row.  And as you can tell the 5 foot strip of concrete is not big enough to put all of our cans AND the recycling 5 feet away from our cans. Can you please help?	Residential Trash/Recycle Cart Request
The dog was loose when I was walking by with my dog and the dog charged us and nipped my dog.  I have reported this dog SEVERAL times, once for biting my previous dog.  Two men at this home finally came out to get the dog but they are unable to control it.  I let them know twice that the dog nipped my dog and got NO RESPONSE from either man.  I don't want the dog put down or anything like that but this has been going on for YEARS, literally. If I look in my files I'm sure I could find at least 5 or 6 times I've reported this dog, maybe more.  And that means there have been 20 to 25 times I've had run in's with this dog over the years that I haven't reported.  I'm limited in my walking pattern because of the location and busy streets in the area and this house is located on a city walking trail.  They have raised their fence but the dog either gets out windows or is just outside off leash and harasses the neighborhood.  I know of others in the neighborhood who also avoid this dog.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DOG.	Aggressive Dog

The drain at the intersection of Vista Bonita and Arroyo De Vista appears to be clogged with excess debris, dirt and growing plants.  Because it is clogged the water is diverted to the South and run down into the entry to the arroyo causing erosion of the trail.

As a black women with two young girls, I am bothered by the actions of the man who lives in Apt #8 at 4230 Eubank (Sierra Meadows) towards women.

We have also observed at times marks on the women face. Several time we have seen the women crying and the man using force to keep her from getting away from him.

About 15 minutes ago, a white City of Albuquerque pickup truck ignored a yield sign while merging off of Oak and onto the Panamerican Frontage northbound. This truck nearly hit me, so i honked to alert it of my presence. 

Rather than yeilding, as the sign dictated, the truck then proceeded to force its way into my lane anyway. The driver thought it appropriate to flip me off in the process.

Description of driver: shaved head, sunglasses, hispanic, male.

Not only was this driver acting dangerously, putting citizens at risk; he was also behaving in an extremely unprofessional matter. This is utterly unacceptible for a public employee.

I will be following up on this repeatedly until I am given satisfactory confirmation that disciplinary action has been taken. It should not be difficult given the above information to narrow down who the culprit is.	Other

Last night my recycling bin was on the east side of the trash bin and this morning after pick up, it was on the west side of the trash bin where it had been dumped on its side. I always set my bins up at least 5 feet apart as I know that is important to the drivers. I know the drivers are concerned about time as we in the neighborhood all became aware when one of your drivers deliberately ran over a dog that was in his way on Ranchitos several years ago. Drivers need to stop, pick up the bin, empty, and set it back down, and then proceed to the next home. Thank you.	Other

I really need ALL of these facts to be anonymous, please!
 
There has been a very toxic odor coming from our neighbor's home at 6513 San Francisco Rd. N. E. for quite some time now.  It has gotten worse to the point where I can't even go outside and water my plants or feed our dog.  A few days ago, I went outside and the odor gave me such a bad headache.
 
I have been wanting to report this but my husband doesn't want trouble with the neighbors 'cause he thinks they'll pay us back by damaging our vehicles.  Tonight he approached the neighbor and asked him what that smell was.  The neighbor told him it was old and new gasoline in an old run-down RV that has been parked in their driveway.  He told my husband he was siphoning gas from it to clean it up and something happened to the hose and gasoline gushed out and got all over him and in his driveway.  He then said he buried some in the ground near his back wall.  He said he had a lot of sludge (gasoline and dirt) and that he was putting in in plastic bags.  I'm afraid they're gonna try and put it in thir trash receptacles for tomorrow morning.
 
I'm also worried because I have chili and other plants near his back wall where that gasoline could eventually end up.  I know that is not the proper way to dispose of such a spill.  I'm also concerned because I watch my grandchildren and they love to play outside. 
 
I'm also worried because they're heavy smokers; someone showed up to help him and he had a cigarette in his mouth!

This graffiti has been reported by myself and countless others. Seems to be that the same response we get every time is that it's the DOT's responsibility, but yet it's probably been there for over a year. No one seems to try to progress to get it fixed. If we can get a number or something to try to remedy this horrendous and terrible looking graffiti that would be greatly appreciated. Maybe the DOT can finally take the time to get this cleaned since there is construction beginning at this intersection and put something to prevent these idiots from reaching it.
Thank you for your time.	Graffiti

Motorcycles and cars with aftermarket illegal mufflers and straight pipes are in constant violation of the noise ordinance all over town, but particulaily along Tramway.

I have called on this assault on our ears and  blatant noise pollution numerous times, but no one seems to care.  If we aren't going to enforce the muffler required ordinance, then get rid of it.

Lanes through the intersection are completely faded.  Heavy traffic at rush hours and multiple vehicles are cutting into parallel turning lane.  Please continue lane division from north eagle ranch to west bound paradise.	Traffic Pavement Markings
Getting on to Paseo in the morning during rush hour is of course madness, however turning south from Paradise on to Eagle Ranch many people use the Straight Lane opposed to the turning lane for quicker access and does cause delay for other vehicles and I have seen several cars and drivers being aggressive, in an attempt to get in 'line' sooner as well as very close accidents occurring because of cars turning illegally to avoid staying in the appropriate lane. I access Paseo everyday and I have seen this happen everyday and I finally got frustrated today and needed to email because of the aggressive drivers and because of people utilizing this aspect as a turning lane when it is not causing other drivers to swerve and get more aggressive.  I just feel like something needs to be done if either a sign can be put up indicating no turn or some kind of barrier to indicate no turn but it's just ridiculous.	Other
It is not clear which lane to use to make a right turn from southbound Eagle Ranch to westbound Paradise Blvd. Traffic is either going past the cones and turning or cutting thru the cordoned off area. I was almost hit on the right side by a vehicle doing the latter maneuver. Which way is correct?	Other

The corner of paradise Blvd east bound and Eaglranch south bound needs a No Right Turn sign for the center lane. Peaple are taking the center lane to go around the island cutting off those using the proper turn lane. So a sign is needed. It would be also useful to post police at this intersection to prevent and site these drivers going around the island cutting off those using the proper turn lane.	Other

Adjusting the synchronization of this traffic light could make traffic flow more smoothly.   For the MORNING commute, if the left turn arrow for traffic turning FROM Eagle Ranch Rd onto Paradise activated AFTER the traffic going straight ahead on Eagle Ranch Rd towards PDN, then it would be much more equitable in terms of whose ‘turn’ it is.  Right now, while that left turn is active, all of the traffic turning right onto Eagle Ranch from Paradise gets in first (in the gap) and when it’s Eagle Ranch’s turn, there is no space left so the intersection gets blocked and only about 3 cars get through the intersection during the traffic light cycle.  

It would be really helpful if someone could come study the traffic and adjust the traffic light (left turn activation).	Other
The turning lanes from Eagle Ranch north turning onto Paradise headed west need to be repainted. Because it is a double turn lane some can't navigate without the stripes. Hurry!	Other

At 11:55 Sunday morning the vehicle in the attached picture was driving southbound on Rhode Island NE.  This vehicle was driving at a high rate of speed.  The driver then drove through the Stop Sign at the intersection of Claremont and Rhode Island.  My wife and I were walking our dogs and were standing on the Northeast corner of Rhode Island and Claremont.  When the driver blew through the stop sign my wife yelled “Hey”. 
The Driver the pulled into 2733 Rhode Island NE, got out of the car and immediately started yelling profanities at us.  Telling us to mind our own business.  
If this was a normal Sunday there would have been a large amount of traffic.  Additionally, kids play in this are every day we were just glad no one was there because they could have been hurt.  I realize there may have been an emergency but there are better ways to handle those situations.	Other

Overgrown and littered.  Fences should be required for dumps like this.	Vacant Lots
Since the intersection at Madison Ave and New Scotland Ave has been closed due to the sinkhole repairs, there has been an increase in people squatting at vacant 558 Madison Ave (there's a couch that's been dragged to the New Scotland side of the building from up the street) and hanging around the surrounding properties (not vacant). The steps of several buildings (including the one I live in) seem to be attracting people that stay overnight and leave food wrappers, empty beverage containers and small plastic bags behind them. Today is the 3rd day in a row that I have walked out of my building in the morning to find the litter all over my steps and noticed that buildings near me also have litter left upon their steps (I doubt the inhabitants are leaving it and are probably tired of cleaning it up everyday, too). I know that these roads are closed but I'm wondering if if the police could make a little U-turn through this area during the night; their presence may dissuade people from loitering?

When turning left from S Manning Blvd onto Western Ave, there used to be a left turn arrow that would illuminate.  The left turn arrow has not illuminated the past couple of days, ever since the new traffic signal at that intersection became operational.  The lack of a left turn arrow is causing a large backup of traffic on S Manning Blvd attempting to turn left onto Western Ave.  Additionally, the location of the signal is very hard to see from the left turn lane of S Manning Blvd.  Please fix the left turn arrow.

Parks department NOT social distancing!

In the recent days as the number of Coronavirus cases increase & the mandate from the NY State governor to social distance, it is appalling that I witnessed a NYC Parks department van which was packed full of employees exit the van for work.

This is an outrageous display of NYC employees especially with stay home and social distancing mandate.  Those NYC employees (parks department) do have family members waiting for them at home. 

What happens if an elder (or younger) that is being cared for catches the Coronavirus as a DIRECT RESULT of the lack of social distancing that the parks department is practicing?

If people cannot utilize the parks due to social distancing, why is the parks department cleaning bathrooms? ALSO, if the parks department is working, why are the playgrounds not being sanitized to stop the spread?

Why aren’t these supplies, gloves, masks, cleaners being donated to the first responders & hospitals to help?

No matter how fine a job anyone does there is always something distracting from it. My name is John Taglialatela Sr. I am a 64 year old retired FDNY EMS Lieutenant. I am disabled from WTC-9-11. Recently my home was robbed. The 122 Precinct Detective Squad did an amazing job investigating, and apprehending the perpetrators. The District Attorney did an equally impressive job in securing convictions. My property was recovered and sent to the Property Clerks Office at One Edgewater Plaza. I am very sick from 9-11 and was happy to be notified I could pick up my belongings. I was notified on Saturday. I got to the clerks office the following Monday. After a long tiring walk I was advised my property was sent to the Pearson Place warehouse in Queens. This is ridiculous. I’m disabled and have no way of retrieving my items.

The NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection has trucks digging up Nevins Street and closing off traffic. As a result, trucks and buses cannot make the unexpected turn onto Dean St. and currently a big bus is stuck in the intersection, causing traffic tie-ups and a cascade of honking horns - right outside of an elementary school and residential area. When we asked the DOEP manager on the job (sitting in his idling truck, said his name was Jefferson) to close off the street or signal to driver that there is work ahead to avoid traffic jams, he belligerently said it wasn't his problem. This is unsensitive, unresponsive city government at its worst!	Other

It has been a frustrating 6 years of dealing with the lack of maintenance from these two properties. The grass and weeds are as tall, if not taller than the fences in the backyard. The front lawn is outgrown, there's an overgrowth of bushes and plants on both properties. This situation has caused serious alarming insect problems, it's very concerning and overwhelming because children and animals are are being effected by this - they're being consumed by a large number of insects and ticks, very unsafe. Due to a house fire several years ago, the 691 Myrtle Ave property has been left unkept and unoccupied for years.

Earlier this week, I reported the need for snow removal at the CVS Plaza located at 1170 Western Avenue.   The snow has not been properly cleared and has now iced over.  The curb, sidewalk, and the bus stop cut away should be clear.  A pedestrian has to leap over a snow bank and ice to board a bus.  As I am not able to do this, I am being forced to stand in a roadway.  Western Avenue has a high volume of traffic and such an action could result in serious injury if not be fatal.

Please assist me to resolve this issue and further ensure that this site is clear of all debris for the remainder of the winter.  Thank you.	Snow and Ice Removal

After this happened I was speaking with a contractor from another Albany neighborhood working in the area who was stunned by the impunity of this activity which he has heard repeatedly in the few weeks on the job. (I know this sounds like a fantasy response to bolster my complaint but it happened)  He remarked that if this was him or me (implying that if this happened in his neighboorhood) we'd be busted that day.

For months, there has been a large pile of asphalt, gravel and cement blocking the pedestrian walkway at the entrance to Knox Mall near Madison. If this is left over from the Madison street construction, get rid of it. If it's for some other purpose, use it or remove it. It has blocked the egress all summer long and looks terrible to everyone including all of the people attending Park Playhouse.  Who is looking out for Washington Park? It's becoming a dumping ground for trash, construction vehicles/material,  a homeless encampment, and a place to get drunk, do drugs, fight, make noise, drag race, and illegally drive and park on the grass. This park, and the community, deserve better.	Other

This small wooded field is being used as a party spot for teens, a dump site for garbage, brush and asphault. Looks horrible not to mention illegal and im sure the property owners around there dont want to look at that in thier backyards. Im not pointing fingers but theres a construction crew that rents garages right next to this mess. I have also obseved a person from Pro value landscaping dumping tree debris there, the sign being posted right on the back of the trailer. Someone needs to take responsibilty to clean this up perhaps the property owner? This was originally posted and complained about back in November and here it is April?? Photos to follow.........

I have come to the conclusion nobody cares anymore the commuters on there way to work to the trucks speeding by using there Jake brakes to slow downtown the schools buses speeding by to pick up children and even the police zooming by.  Who do you contact to let people know nobody has slowed down, there is NO Police presents that's why nobody cares anymore.

I witnessed a pedestrian getting hit by a car this morning when she had the right of way crossing South Main heading West on New Scotland. Part of the problem is that the crosswalks in this intersection are nearly impossible to see. They should be repainted.

This light cycle seems to be much longer than it used to. I have gotten stuck on S Main, trying to turn left onto New Scotland and have to wait almost 5 minutes for the light to change.	Traffic Signal Repairs
The traffic light here seems to have been changed and the wait to move on Main across New Scotland is longer. This is causing traffic to get pretty backed up on Main and since there are no turning arrows, prompting those in front that need to turn to jump in front of traffic. I fear an accident is forthcoming. Always up for improved traffic flow but this seems to be a step in the wrong direction.	Traffic Signal Repairs

Sidewalk not cleared of snow and or ice!!!  (side street)	Snow and Ice Removal
Again these residents or owners fail to clear the sidewalks.  There is no evidence that the city has been responding to complaints!  Maybe the people are on the city payroll or just maybe it is payola!  Do we have to beg to get action against these people?  It is disgusting that they continue to neglect their civic duty and get away with it!	Snow and Ice Removal
i don't know why i'm writing this - this marks the third such message i've written here in about 10 weeks, not to mention phone calls i've made to the city, and nothing gets done. i'm not sure these notes are even read; it feels like i'm getting robotic responses. still, one more time because we want to get rid of an eyesore and plant a tree: 
 
we have a stump in front of our house that has been there about 20 weeks now and it's flat and ugly and the shade its tree provided is gone.  about 20 weeks ago, the city cut down the tree that had been there at least 25 years, leaving the stump. when that happened, the crew chief told me that the city would remove the stump "in about two weeks." 18 weeks and three messages later, we're still waiting.	Tree Issues
14 weeks ago, the city forester's office took down an old tree in front of our house. the crew chief told me then that "within two  weeks" another crew would come out to remove the stump. it hasn't been done. i wrote a notice about this to this website two weeks ago and got a reply saying that city would respond. i've not had any action taken on the stump. it's an eyesore and we'd like to replace it with a tree. how long will it take before the city removes the stump, please?

Limb downed by storm. Tree should be put on list for city to prune severely so other dry branches do not break. Thanks.	Tree Issues
Large branch downed by storm and obstructing sidewalk.	Street Cleaning
about 12 weeks ago, a city crew took down the tree in front of my house. the crew chief  told me that another crew would remove the stump in 2 weeks. the stump's still there. i would appreciate it if the city would remove the stump. we want to plant another tree there and improve barren spot.

Boxelder tree produces boxelder insects which fly all over the back of neighboring houses causing them to nest and/or infest in the houses.  Their is no danger from them except that they get into the homes and who wants bugs in their house or bugs dropping of flying into their food?  Would like the owner of the tree to either spray it or cut it back.  I've had to spray the back of my house because the bugs are trying to nest under the wood siding.	Tree Issues

I am an RN at Albany Medical Center and I was unable to leave my parking spot this morning due to the illegally parked White Honda Civic in front of me. I was parked in a legal spot however the illegally parked vehicle pulled up so close to my vehicle that there was absolutely no room for me to safely pull out without hitting their car or rhe one behind me.  This individual has repeatedly parked there despite us asking them not to for this reason. Luckily my husband was parked in back of me and was able to back up and give me some room to work with however I did still end up hitting his car due to lack of space.

 How is this safe if healthcare workers can't get to their job because people have no regard laws?

Please advise.	Parking Enforcement

This newer neighbor's dog barks incessantly in the backyard at people walking by, trucks/cars passing by, at us when we are anywhere on that side of our home, and barks whenever another dog is in the area. The neighbor seems oblivious to the noise. Other neighbors are also complaining. We've called TPD in the past but their help never lasts long. Often the dog barks all afternoon or late into the night  if the neighbor isn't at work. This is very irritating especially now since folks are able to have windows and doors open often.

Hello, I tried calling non-emergency multiple times with no luck, at around 7:10pm tonight (11-8-2018) a mid 90's white Chevy suburban hit a deer across the street from my house and left.

There was no listing for animal concerns, so I wasn't sure which category to choose.	Street Sweeping Request

The grass has not been cut in awhile. This is a duplex  and there is bags of trash in the containers and on the ground under the stairs going up stairs at the side of the house. There is a trash and recycling container at the curb that has been sitting there for about 8 weeks. After our pickup last Friday, someone put bags in one container that is laying on the ground with the lid open. I do not know the last time they put any trash out. I and two other homes are treating our home for roaches (can't say for sure where they came from). We have had a rat problem in the past, do not want the again. We hope the city will do something about the slum property. Thank you.	Junk,debris,tall grass&weeds,broken vehicles
I live at 549 Spencer St. Our alley is one block long, between Colburn St. and Prouty. There are some areas that need cleaning. But the biggest problem is the pot holes.

Illegal dumping. It is possible that this is the incorrect address for this lot, however the location is impossible to miss. What started off as a small pile of dead branches, has grown to a pile of branches, car parts, furniture and whatever other junk people have decided to dump on this property. The more junk that is added to the pile .... more junk is added to the pile. Hopefully removing the junk and debris will discourage the thought that this property is an ideal spot for easy, no-punishment dumping.

Cross the street from the United Way building (50 Waugh’s Dr) to the bus stop headed north at S Heights @ Willia is very unsafe. 1) There are multiple lanes of traffic to cross in both directions.

As they tried to let me cross, other drivers flew by or nearly hit those who did stop. 3) When I stood in the crosswalk so that drivers across the lanes could better see me, I felt very unsafe standing in the middle of the street with drivers going at high speeds on both sides. 4) The sidewalk is uneven right at the stop.

Cars are able to park on both sides of Speedway at the north side of the intersection of Speedway and 45th.  Having cars parked at the intersection creates dangerous congestion.  For example, if a car is facing south on the north side of the intersection and is waiting to turn left, there is not adequate space for vehicles heading north on Speedway to cross into the north side of the intersection, and someone on the north side has to reverse.  Cyclists are pushed very close to the moving cars by the parked cars, and I have nearly accidently hit cyclists that are in the street when I turn left from 45th street to head north on Speedway.  Please review this intersection and consider removing parking spaces on street right next to intersection.  Thank you.	Other

The road in the left turn lane on 200 South at the 300 West intersection is warped to the point that it makes contact with my vehicle when I pass over it.	Rough Road
It's more of a manhole cover that is too deep which feels like a pothole so it needs to be smoothed out and filled in more so the car can go over it more smoothly without risk of damage. Please & thanks	Pothole

Zwick construction has 2 lanes that curve left and then back. The problem is that the old stripe that indicates to go straight is showing though. As it is no longer blacked out, cars in the right lane enter the curve and then go straight out cutting off the car in the left lane. The "straight" stripe needs to be blacked out. And an arrow directing traffic to CONTINUE through the bend is needed.
I've been run off the road or had to slam on brakes to avoid hitting the car in the right lane that drives straight into my lane.	Striping

Hello. In the Morning between the hours of 7am and 10am the green light traffic signals headed Northbound and Southbound are way to short.  When the morning commute comes in the traffic backs up along 5th east and blocks driveways and creates other co gestion problems.  Sometimes it can take 20 minutes to get inbetween 500 Soth through 400 south. The green light needs to be at least 5 seconds longer. It would get us through the light much faster and avoid frustration, road-rage, dangerous situations and congestion.	Traffic Signals

Length of Green Light has shortened in last week  and is causing backing south of intersection	Traffic Signals
Several times in recent days I have sat at the southbound left turn onto 1300 S, attempting to head east into the St. Mary's neighborhood and have sat through 2-4 cycles of lights. Finally I have exited the lane and turned at the next intersection. Several other neighbors that I asked have experienced the same issue. The city recently blocked traffic from making left turns from Laird Way on to 1300 S, even for local residents, which is forcing all traffic to turn at the light that is not functioning.  I have witnessed multiple people pulling erratic U turns, turning left on the red light when it is clear, or cutting back into heavy traffic. This is getting dangerous and needs to be addressed. The sensors do not seem to be working correctly.	Traffic Signals
My apologies for bothering you with a relatively mundane traffic issue, but I drive my kids to school each weekday, and almost without fail, cars block the intersection (facing northbound) on Foothill Drive and 1300 S. making it difficult for those heading west to make the short light. Not sure that a "Do Not Block Intersection" sign would make any significant difference, but might be worth trying? : )	Signage
The light for a left turn from northbound Foothill Drive to westbound 1300 S has an extremely long wait time on Sunday mornings, when there is very little opposing traffic. A yield light or shorter cycle would be helpful. I fully understand that left turns must be fully protected during evening commute hours due to traffic patterns and high accident rates.	Traffic Signals
	Traffic Signals
This signal needs fixing. First, the turn signals should have flasher yellow/caution for left turns. Second, randomly at weird times of the day the left turn to head westbound on 1300 S doesn't turn green. Just sat through three cycles without a left green turn signal. This has happen a few times to me recently. Not fun.

Appreciate your attention to this.

Thank you!

The main drainage ditch that funnels rain runoff from Idlewyld Road transverse a my lot and is severely eroded in my back yard.

There is a big shortage of parking spaces on-street in Oregon Hill. Here are two suggestions to free a few spaces: Unnecessary restricted parking signs are posted in three different spots on the 200 block & 300 block of S Cherry St. At 224 S. Cherry St. the William Byrd Community House has curtailed its operations & more or less closed down. So it is not using the bus loading zone or the handicapped parking zone that takes up 4-6 spaces. I haven't seen any of those spaces being used for months now. Would you consider removing those restricted parking signs in front of 224 S Cherry St.
At 328 S Cherry St, there is  a 1-hour restricted parking zone (taking up 2-3 car spaces) in front of a building that used to be a retail commercial establishment. But there hasn't been a commercial establishment there for upwards of 10 years. Can you consider removing that sign & letting anyone park there? Thank you.	Other

Snow removal from city sidewalks - I am a resident of Shokoe Bottom and have the ability to utilize public transportation or walk to go to and from work. Today I chose to walk - as I ventured from my home I realized very quickly the sidewalks have not been cleared!  CVS on the corner of 25th & Main had a path for pedestrians but what was shocking was Farm Fresh had not cleared the sidewalk!  Not only had they not cleared the sidewalk but there wasn't any snow in their parking lot which was filled with cars!  The snow stopped on Saturday and on Tuesday morning there is no path for people to walk!  As I continued on my walk to work I continued to have to walk thru un-shoveled paths on Main Street!  Honey Whytes, Whisk, Station 3, Southern Kitchen, Sweet Teas and the Amtrak station did an exceptional job of clearing the sidewalks for pedestrians - why aren't businesses being cited for violating the Richmond City Code 90-42 which mandates sidewalks must be cleared with 6 hours of snow stoppage!   The government managed to remove snow from all walkways I had no trouble walking on the sidewalks once I entered government property!	Other

People to want to come to Richmond from all over to see things like the monuments and various other aspects of our history. Just a suggestion, I think that probably what needs to be done is to put up some signs, on the Confederate monuments, which say that these were placed here by people of another era and different perspectives. We do not endorse what they stood for, in their civil war actions, we simply leave them as a reminder of what happened back then and as a warning to present and future generations. Having said something like that, the state and city and various interested groups could work on making Monument Avenue really live up to its name. Monument Avenue is a very long avenue. There is room there for many future monuments. The Ashe Monument was a good start for non-Confederate monuments. There are many people and groups who would be worthy of memorializing with monuments, statues, etc. along Monument Avenue in between the Confederate monuments and on past them all the way out to Horsepen Road in Henrico County. Handled tastefully, Monument Avenue could become a wonder to behold and a much more positive representation of the Richmond area and of Virginia's history.	Other

When I commute to work via bicycle, my route takes me across Mayo's Bridge. The storm drain grates on the bridge are extremely dangerous to ride over because they're installed inches below the level of the asphalt. This would not be a problem if I could safely ride to the left of the grates, but drivers routinely exceed the speed limit by 10 or 15 miles per hour, and they often don't give other bicyclists and me the mandated two feet of space they're supposed to do. My dilemma becomes riding over the dangerously uneven storm drains, or running the risk of being plowed down by several tons of speeding metal. Please, please, PLEASE enforce the speed limit on Mayo's Bridge. Better yet, enforce the speed limit and reduce it to 25 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on either end of the bridge. I invite any police officers assigned to this area to ride with me one morning or evening to experience my commute.	Other
I am a sometime bicycle commuter, and my way to work takes me across Mayo's Bridge, continuing south on Hull Street to Belt Boulevard. The road on the bridge is in terrible shape, and the storm drain grates are so poorly installed that I have to avoid them by riding further in the traffic lane than I ordinarily would. This wouldn't be a huge problem if drivers obeyed the speed limit going across the bridge. Unfortunately, they don't. I routinely observe drivers doing 40 or 50 miles per hour across the bridge. It's completely unsafe, both for those of us observing the laws AND the people who flout them. Riding across the Mayo Bridge in that kind of traffic can be a terrifying experience. I don't believe it should be. Please do something permanent to get drivers to observe the speed limit (and why not reduce the speed limit across the bridge to 25, as it is Downtown and in Manchester). Please don't wait for another bicycle injury or fatality to address this and other safety issues.	Other
Yesterday we walked the dog from the Northside of 14th street and across the bridge to the south side of the James on 14th street to check out the Slave trail footpaths.  I couldn't even navigate my dog out of all of the broken glass to get him across safely. There was tons of garbage especially in front of the Mayo Island area and someone's been living and throwing garbage right under the bridge which is in plain view when walking across. I was surprised this area was not better maintained as it is currently well travelled and will become more so as the Manchester area develops.  Please send a crew to get this area cleaned.  My guess is that it hasn't been cleaned in a long long time.  Thank you.	Trash/Bulk Pick-ups

Since the hurricane the traffic light at the intersection of Stony Point Pkwy at the entrance to the Fashion Mall is not operating properly.  Very long delays even when there is no traffic.	Non-functioning Traffic Lights
I live in a town home community behind Stony Point Fashion Mall.  The only access in and out of the area is Chippenham Pkwy. which means we can neither walk or ride a bicycle, moped, etc, out of the area.  In other words if you don't have a regular vehicle you're trapped.  There is no other way out even for emergency purposes.  This is true for the fashion mall as well as a large office park located at the same exit.  There are several chained and locked gates in the general areas but they are located on private property.

Light at Chippenham South and Stony Point Parkway has now been elongated so much that 4 o'clock traffic leaving office /medical buildings back up to light exiting northbound Chippenham. And 5 o'clock traffic is backed up from left turn onto Chippenham south to intersection at MCV medical center blocking people trying to go North on Chippenham. And giving people exiting office building difficulty getting into left turn lane for Chippenham south. Waited 1 min 15 seconds yesterday for left turn light onto Chippenham with little traffic going to or exiting SP Fashion Park. Again, this is as dangerous as long unneeded left turn and exit lights (other than rush hour) on Huguenot at Stony Point Rd and Chippenham south exit. People get anxious and speed or weave in and out. Who has messed up all these lights? 2 minutes sitting at 5:45am to exit Stony Point Rd onto Huguenot. Another 40 plus seconds at Chippenham south exit for little or no traffic in am? It's just plain dumb! All these lights were fine before power outage 2 (?) years ago. And now they just keep getting worse each time they play with them.	Traffic light

Big Deep Pot hole, Address: 2200 Magnolia Street, Richmond, VA, 23223. Just after crossing Magnolia Ct. in the farthest right hand lane of Magnolia Street going south bound towards the Magnolia and Mechanicsville Trpk intersection. The pot hole is so big, it bent the rim on my passenger side front, I could not avoid hitting it, it is that big. I hit the pot hole last night 1-3-11 at approx. 5:20PM and reported it to VDOT who told me to report it to you all. I hope some one will come out very soon and fix the pot hole so that no one else hits it. Looking forward to some progress. Thanks, Monetha Whitney	Potholes

How much longer is the city going to leave the stretch of Main St. heading east between Poe's Pub and the Wharf unmarked? The intersection of Main St. and Williamsburg Rd. is already a problem area as folks turning left onto Williamsburg Rd. have a bad habit of starting their turn early or "rounding it off". I have had a couple semi close calls there in the past. It has been nearly a month since this stretch of road was repaved. It is high time the road markings were redone. This spot is already an accident waiting to happen. The lack of road markings just makes it that much worse. I would also suggest a "TURN HERE" sign on the pavement for the folks turning left on Williamsburg Rd.	Other

There are big Pot holes all along the railroad tracks crossing the highway in the 2800 block of North Hopkins road-near the intersection of Hopkins and Jeff Davis highway.
Cars must slow to 5 mph (from 40mph) so as not to damage their suspensions and alignments  while  crossing the tracks on Hopkins road in both directions.
Several months ago DPW came and filled in only 1 or 2 of the potholes and left all the others unfilled and never came back. Now the ones they filled have reoccurred and the others pot holes never filled have gotten bigger.

Please send out crews to fix All of the potholes lining the Railroad tracks or come up with a more permanent fix so they do not need filled every 3 months as it is now.
Thanks for your help from all the vehicles traveling this busy section of Hopkins road daily. It is used by all the city school buses and trash trucks  and police vehicles located at 3200 Hopkins road depot site as well as all the other commercial and residential traffic.	Potholes

The Railroad crossing on N. Hopkins Rd within 2 blocks of Jeff Davis Highway is in bad need of repair.  Most traffic has to slow to a rolling stop to travers the tracks safely; but, the potholes are getting worse in both directions.  I realize that the RailRoad may be responsible, but I hope the City can initiate some action.  Many people now swerve a little into the other lane, to cross where there potholes are not so deep.  There is a chance of hitting on-coming traffic by so doing.	Potholes

A disconcerting number of dead tadpoles in and around the Bryan Park pond. Seems like more involved than the cold snap. Wondering if anyone knows what happened over there - something in the water?	Other
The pond on the southern edge of Bryan Park is significantly drained and stagnant. The fountain has not run at all this spring or summer and has filled with weeds. There is a stench of raw sewage that surrounds the area of the pond. This pond alone could produce enough mosquitoes to plague all of Bellevue, Ginter Park and Battery Park. It is a shame that such a beautiful water feature has been neglected, and considering continued public access to the park, it should be kept in good working order.	Other
The gates to the road access around Bryan Park are being left open again this season and there continue to be individuals parking along the wooded areas toward the back of the Park and sitting in their vehicles starting at 6:30 in the morning.  Based on the history of this Park, this needs to be addressed.  Unauthorized vehicles are not allowed past the soccer field parking area, but these individuals continue to be in this area loitering or watching.  This is a family park.	Other
This season, unlike last Spring, the gates at Joseph Bryan Park have been opened and the paved areas have become not only a magnet for folks who drive through faster than necessary but also some men who back their cars in shady spots, wear sunglasses and hats, and appear to loiter. This starts in the morning hours before work, all day during the weekend, and in the evenings during the week. Given the history of the issues that this has created in the past, it seems like it might be necessary to close the gates to all vehicles except those belonging to the City or the Police. Children play in the Park and it just does not seem safe to assume that these individuals sitting in cars apparently not making any normal use of the Park are there for any good reason.

It would be unsafe for park users to approach these individuals and ask them what they are doing. 

Please address this issue.	Other

I am a sometime bicycle commuter, and my way to work takes me across Mayo's Bridge, continuing south on Hull Street to Belt Boulevard. The road on the bridge is in terrible shape, and the storm drain grates are so poorly installed that I have to avoid them by riding further in the traffic lane than I ordinarily would. This wouldn't be a huge problem if drivers obeyed the speed limit going across the bridge. Unfortunately, they don't. I routinely observe drivers doing 40 or 50 miles per hour across the bridge. It's completely unsafe, both for those of us observing the laws AND the people who flout them. Riding across the Mayo Bridge in that kind of traffic can be a terrifying experience. I don't believe it should be. Please do something permanent to get drivers to observe the speed limit (and why not reduce the speed limit across the bridge to 25, as it is Downtown and in Manchester). Please don't wait for another bicycle injury or fatality to address this and other safety issues.	Other

I couldn't even navigate my dog out of all of the broken glass to get him across safely. There was tons of garbage especially in front of the Mayo Island area and someone's been living and throwing garbage right under the bridge which is in plain view when walking across. I was surprised this area was not better maintained as it is currently well travelled and will become more so as the Manchester area develops.  Please send a crew to get this area cleaned.  My guess is that it hasn't been cleaned in a long long time.  Thank you.	Trash/Bulk Pick-ups

A warrant for the arrest of Richmond Police Officer has recently been issued by the Magistrate's Office for an alleged assault against a unarmed security guard. 



This incident occurred around 2:30am this past Sunday morning in a parking deck located at 1001 Haxall Point in Richmond.  This off-duty police officer was leaving the Black Finn Restaurant and was at the parking deck's booth to pay parking fees when he became involved in an irate argument with the property's security officers about amount of the fees.  It is claimed that the off-duty officer opened his vehicle's door pinning a security officer against the parking booth.  The officer said he had to force the door shut to free himself.  Upon doing so, this off-duty officer (vehicle's driver), shouted, "Nigger, I will shoot your @#$%", then got out of the car and grabbed the unarmed security officer's chest.  An occupant from the passenger side then exited the vehicle and displayed a Richmond Police badge.  It is believed, soon after the assault, this second individual left the scene.  The assaulted security claimed his assailant smelled heavily of alcohol.

It is believed the off-duty officer who is claimed to have assaulted the unarmed security officer may have been previously disciplined by the department after having been indirectly involved in a similar incident in Shockoe Bottom where there was an attempt to cover up an assault by another off-duty Richmond Police Officer(s).



I fear this recent incident outside the Black Finn will not be diligently investigated internally nor managed by the Richmond Police Department.  Seems some Richmond Police Officers historically engage in the consumption of alcohol while off-duty and lose their ability and desire to maintain the level of professionalism expected by the citizens of Richmond.  The Richmond Police Department needs to command this same expectation of their officers.	Other
There is an unsecured access door in the road that was not bolted back down. It rocks open when cars drive over it, and bangs open and shut violently (and loudly) during strong wind. 
Anyone curious can easily open up the panel, and accidentally fall 25' to land on sewer equipment - very dangerous.
Please re-secure access panel.

There is a homeless guy(s) living on the riverside of the concrete wall adjacent to the Dominion Power sub-station.   It is a cesspool of filth including what are probably numerous stolen and broken bicycles.  The area needs to be cleaned up as it is unsanitary. This is accessible from Brown's Island via walking on the pipeline.	Illegal Dumping
Please consider paving this gravel area as it is a trip hazard to pedestrians transitioning from the end of the mural section of the canal walk to the asphalt area below.  This area will receive a lot of additional foot traffic during the bike races and would be in the city's best interest to make this safer for all of our guests.	Other

LIghts along Kingston Dr are out, making it dangerous to walk at night.	Street Light
Kingston Dr is a cut through street to Kingston Elementary and the back of Kings Grant. The foot traffic in the morning and afternoons contains a high volume of children traveling to and from the school and bus stops. Kinnston Dr also experiences a high volume of cars driving quickly causing the children to move to the grass or gutters of the street to avoid being hit. Even without exceeding the 25mph speed limit it is extremely dangerous for two cars in opposite directions to pass at the same time while children are walking in the street. The speed needs to be reduced during school hours, enforced, or side walks need to provide safer paths for the children.	Other Roadway Issues

I had a package stolen off my porch on 2/6 ( the same day a hypodermic needle was on my steps).  There was a man walking up and down the street that day, my neighbor went out and asked what he was doing- waiting for a ride was his answer. We were not home when this occurred. Yesterday, 3/6, I had 3 packages stolen. A man with a large backpack was seen on Front Street again yesterday. Front Street residents beware if you are having anything delivered. The window of time that the packages are stolen is less than 2 hours from delivery.  I live in the block between Pine and Chatham Street.	Policing Issue

A large tree fell at 79 James Street in Hamden onto a fence. The homeowner is currently without resources to have it removed if Public Works could provide assistance.  Thank you.

Why are trucks allowed to double park on Elm Street during rush hour traffic? This happens nearly every day, sometimes with delivery trucks on both sides of the street such that a three lane road becomes single file. Traffic is often snarled up back to the Shops at Yale and the intersecting streets due to cars unintentionally 'blocking the box'. Please enforce parking laws!	Parking Violation/Abandoned Auto

With the constant snowfall, elm street has regularly been getting plowed, but the bike lane has been covered in a snow bank since at least the beginning of January. What good is a bike lane if it never gets plowed?	SNOW RELATED

Several cars constantly parked in the street for more than the allowed permit time while we, the residences, can't park because almost 50% of the area is marked with "Emergency not parking". However the people doing the construction are happily parked and no enforcement.	Parking Enforcement

Why is the person charged with enforcing the parking laws egregiously violating then? This is an unattended double parked vehicle. There was an open, proper parking space right in front of it. This creates a dangerous situation in which southbound traffic has to drive in the oncoming traffic lane.	Parking Enforcement
