Trees are brushing against active power lines. This was reported several times before, most recently on Saturday, April 14. I don't understand why the city is not doing anything about this. This situation is hazardous and could start a fire. The last time we had winds exceeding 30mph, sparks were raining down in my yard. I share a back fence with this property.

The property is vacant, currently. House is for sale. Elderly woman recently moved out.	Wildfire Prevention
Please see 15-00176619 3-1-1 ticket and previous seeclickfix ticket http://seeclickfix.com/issues/1804291. This is the same issue. Only now the power lines are arcing with strong wind gusts. This was previously reported timely, and the city has done nothing so far to remedy the situation. Please come trim the trees before there is a fire.

I called 9-1-1 earlier today, and the AFD came out and assessed the situation, calling in a pole number.	Other

The road in the left turn lane on 200 South at the 300 West intersection is warped to the point that it makes contact with my vehicle when I pass over it.	Rough Road
It's more of a manhole cover that is too deep which feels like a pothole so it needs to be smoothed out and filled in more so the car can go over it more smoothly without risk of damage. Please & thanks	Pothole

Zwick construction has 2 lanes that curve left and then back. The problem is that the old stripe that indicates to go straight is showing though. As it is no longer blacked out, cars in the right lane enter the curve and then go straight out cutting off the car in the left lane. The "straight" stripe needs to be blacked out. And an arrow directing traffic to CONTINUE through the bend is needed.
I've been run off the road or had to slam on brakes to avoid hitting the car in the right lane that drives straight into my lane.	Striping

Hello. In the Morning between the hours of 7am and 10am the green light traffic signals headed Northbound and Southbound are way to short.  When the morning commute comes in the traffic backs up along 5th east and blocks driveways and creates other co gestion problems.  Sometimes it can take 20 minutes to get inbetween 500 Soth through 400 south. The green light needs to be at least 5 seconds longer. It would get us through the light much faster and avoid frustration, road-rage, dangerous situations and congestion.	Traffic Signals

Length of Green Light has shortened in last week  and is causing backing south of intersection	Traffic Signals
Several times in recent days I have sat at the southbound left turn onto 1300 S, attempting to head east into the St. Mary's neighborhood and have sat through 2-4 cycles of lights. Finally I have exited the lane and turned at the next intersection. Several other neighbors that I asked have experienced the same issue. The city recently blocked traffic from making left turns from Laird Way on to 1300 S, even for local residents, which is forcing all traffic to turn at the light that is not functioning.  I have witnessed multiple people pulling erratic U turns, turning left on the red light when it is clear, or cutting back into heavy traffic. This is getting dangerous and needs to be addressed. The sensors do not seem to be working correctly.	Traffic Signals
My apologies for bothering you with a relatively mundane traffic issue, but I drive my kids to school each weekday, and almost without fail, cars block the intersection (facing northbound) on Foothill Drive and 1300 S. making it difficult for those heading west to make the short light. Not sure that a "Do Not Block Intersection" sign would make any significant difference, but might be worth trying? : )	Signage
The light for a left turn from northbound Foothill Drive to westbound 1300 S has an extremely long wait time on Sunday mornings, when there is very little opposing traffic. A yield light or shorter cycle would be helpful. I fully understand that left turns must be fully protected during evening commute hours due to traffic patterns and high accident rates.	Traffic Signals
	Traffic Signals
This signal needs fixing. First, the turn signals should have flasher yellow/caution for left turns. Second, randomly at weird times of the day the left turn to head westbound on 1300 S doesn't turn green. Just sat through three cycles without a left green turn signal. This has happen a few times to me recently. Not fun.

Appreciate your attention to this.

Thank you!

south bound traffic turning left has a long waite and therefor there is increased traffic through Laird Way residential street if the turn light was green more often and longer it would decrease cut through traffic.  PLEASE fix this I live on this street.	Traffic Signals
It has happened a few times that turning west off of Foothill onto 1300S takes multiple cycles for the left turn arrow to change. There have been times there is no oncoming traffic for a full light and the arrow still does not come on.	Traffic Signals

There is a big shortage of parking spaces on-street in Oregon Hill. Here are two suggestions to free a few spaces: Unnecessary restricted parking signs are posted in three different spots on the 200 block & 300 block of S Cherry St. At 224 S. Cherry St. the William Byrd Community House has curtailed its operations & more or less closed down. So it is not using the bus loading zone or the handicapped parking zone that takes up 4-6 spaces. I haven't seen any of those spaces being used for months now. Would you consider removing those restricted parking signs in front of 224 S Cherry St.
At 328 S Cherry St, there is  a 1-hour restricted parking zone (taking up 2-3 car spaces) in front of a building that used to be a retail commercial establishment. But there hasn't been a commercial establishment there for upwards of 10 years. Can you consider removing that sign & letting anyone park there? Thank you.	Other

Snow removal from city sidewalks - I am a resident of Shokoe Bottom and have the ability to utilize public transportation or walk to go to and from work. Today I chose to walk - as I ventured from my home I realized very quickly the sidewalks have not been cleared!  CVS on the corner of 25th & Main had a path for pedestrians but what was shocking was Farm Fresh had not cleared the sidewalk!  Not only had they not cleared the sidewalk but there wasn't any snow in their parking lot which was filled with cars!  The snow stopped on Saturday and on Tuesday morning there is no path for people to walk!  As I continued on my walk to work I continued to have to walk thru un-shoveled paths on Main Street!  Honey Whytes, Whisk, Station 3, Southern Kitchen, Sweet Teas and the Amtrak station did an exceptional job of clearing the sidewalks for pedestrians - why aren't businesses being cited for violating the Richmond City Code 90-42 which mandates sidewalks must be cleared with 6 hours of snow stoppage!   The government managed to remove snow from all walkways I had no trouble walking on the sidewalks once I entered government property!	Other

People to want to come to Richmond from all over to see things like the monuments and various other aspects of our history. Just a suggestion, I think that probably what needs to be done is to put up some signs, on the Confederate monuments, which say that these were placed here by people of another era and different perspectives. We do not endorse what they stood for, in their civil war actions, we simply leave them as a reminder of what happened back then and as a warning to present and future generations. Having said something like that, the state and city and various interested groups could work on making Monument Avenue really live up to its name. Monument Avenue is a very long avenue. There is room there for many future monuments. The Ashe Monument was a good start for non-Confederate monuments. There are many people and groups who would be worthy of memorializing with monuments, statues, etc. along Monument Avenue in between the Confederate monuments and on past them all the way out to Horsepen Road in Henrico County. Handled tastefully, Monument Avenue could become a wonder to behold and a much more positive representation of the Richmond area and of Virginia's history.	Other

When I commute to work via bicycle, my route takes me across Mayo's Bridge. The storm drain grates on the bridge are extremely dangerous to ride over because they're installed inches below the level of the asphalt. This would not be a problem if I could safely ride to the left of the grates, but drivers routinely exceed the speed limit by 10 or 15 miles per hour, and they often don't give other bicyclists and me the mandated two feet of space they're supposed to do. My dilemma becomes riding over the dangerously uneven storm drains, or running the risk of being plowed down by several tons of speeding metal. Please, please, PLEASE enforce the speed limit on Mayo's Bridge. Better yet, enforce the speed limit and reduce it to 25 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on either end of the bridge. I invite any police officers assigned to this area to ride with me one morning or evening to experience my commute.	Other
I am a sometime bicycle commuter, and my way to work takes me across Mayo's Bridge, continuing south on Hull Street to Belt Boulevard. The road on the bridge is in terrible shape, and the storm drain grates are so poorly installed that I have to avoid them by riding further in the traffic lane than I ordinarily would. This wouldn't be a huge problem if drivers obeyed the speed limit going across the bridge. Unfortunately, they don't. I routinely observe drivers doing 40 or 50 miles per hour across the bridge. It's completely unsafe, both for those of us observing the laws AND the people who flout them. Riding across the Mayo Bridge in that kind of traffic can be a terrifying experience. I don't believe it should be. Please do something permanent to get drivers to observe the speed limit (and why not reduce the speed limit across the bridge to 25, as it is Downtown and in Manchester). Please don't wait for another bicycle injury or fatality to address this and other safety issues.	Other
Yesterday we walked the dog from the Northside of 14th street and across the bridge to the south side of the James on 14th street to check out the Slave trail footpaths.  I couldn't even navigate my dog out of all of the broken glass to get him across safely. There was tons of garbage especially in front of the Mayo Island area and someone's been living and throwing garbage right under the bridge which is in plain view when walking across. I was surprised this area was not better maintained as it is currently well travelled and will become more so as the Manchester area develops.  Please send a crew to get this area cleaned.  My guess is that it hasn't been cleaned in a long long time.  Thank you.	Trash/Bulk Pick-ups

Since the hurricane the traffic light at the intersection of Stony Point Pkwy at the entrance to the Fashion Mall is not operating properly.  Very long delays even when there is no traffic.	Non-functioning Traffic Lights
I live in a town home community behind Stony Point Fashion Mall.  The only access in and out of the area is Chippenham Pkwy. which means we can neither walk or ride a bicycle, moped, etc, out of the area.  In other words if you don't have a regular vehicle you're trapped.  There is no other way out even for emergency purposes.  This is true for the fashion mall as well as a large office park located at the same exit.  There are several chained and locked gates in the general areas but they are located on private property.

Light at Chippenham South and Stony Point Parkway has now been elongated so much that 4 o'clock traffic leaving office /medical buildings back up to light exiting northbound Chippenham. And 5 o'clock traffic is backed up from left turn onto Chippenham south to intersection at MCV medical center blocking people trying to go North on Chippenham. And giving people exiting office building difficulty getting into left turn lane for Chippenham south. Waited 1 min 15 seconds yesterday for left turn light onto Chippenham with little traffic going to or exiting SP Fashion Park. Again, this is as dangerous as long unneeded left turn and exit lights (other than rush hour) on Huguenot at Stony Point Rd and Chippenham south exit. People get anxious and speed or weave in and out. Who has messed up all these lights? 2 minutes sitting at 5:45am to exit Stony Point Rd onto Huguenot. Another 40 plus seconds at Chippenham south exit for little or no traffic in am? It's just plain dumb! All these lights were fine before power outage 2 (?) years ago. And now they just keep getting worse each time they play with them.	Traffic light

Big Deep Pot hole, Address: 2200 Magnolia Street, Richmond, VA, 23223. Just after crossing Magnolia Ct. in the farthest right hand lane of Magnolia Street going south bound towards the Magnolia and Mechanicsville Trpk intersection. The pot hole is so big, it bent the rim on my passenger side front, I could not avoid hitting it, it is that big. I hit the pot hole last night 1-3-11 at approx. 5:20PM and reported it to VDOT who told me to report it to you all. I hope some one will come out very soon and fix the pot hole so that no one else hits it. Looking forward to some progress. Thanks, Monetha Whitney	Potholes

How much longer is the city going to leave the stretch of Main St. heading east between Poe's Pub and the Wharf unmarked? The intersection of Main St. and Williamsburg Rd. is already a problem area as folks turning left onto Williamsburg Rd. have a bad habit of starting their turn early or "rounding it off". I have had a couple semi close calls there in the past. It has been nearly a month since this stretch of road was repaved. It is high time the road markings were redone. This spot is already an accident waiting to happen. The lack of road markings just makes it that much worse. I would also suggest a "TURN HERE" sign on the pavement for the folks turning left on Williamsburg Rd.	Other

There are big Pot holes all along the railroad tracks crossing the highway in the 2800 block of North Hopkins road-near the intersection of Hopkins and Jeff Davis highway.
Cars must slow to 5 mph (from 40mph) so as not to damage their suspensions and alignments  while  crossing the tracks on Hopkins road in both directions.
Several months ago DPW came and filled in only 1 or 2 of the potholes and left all the others unfilled and never came back. Now the ones they filled have reoccurred and the others pot holes never filled have gotten bigger.

Please send out crews to fix All of the potholes lining the Railroad tracks or come up with a more permanent fix so they do not need filled every 3 months as it is now.
Thanks for your help from all the vehicles traveling this busy section of Hopkins road daily. It is used by all the city school buses and trash trucks  and police vehicles located at 3200 Hopkins road depot site as well as all the other commercial and residential traffic.	Potholes

The Railroad crossing on N. Hopkins Rd within 2 blocks of Jeff Davis Highway is in bad need of repair.  Most traffic has to slow to a rolling stop to travers the tracks safely; but, the potholes are getting worse in both directions.  I realize that the RailRoad may be responsible, but I hope the City can initiate some action.  Many people now swerve a little into the other lane, to cross where there potholes are not so deep.  There is a chance of hitting on-coming traffic by so doing.	Potholes

A disconcerting number of dead tadpoles in and around the Bryan Park pond. Seems like more involved than the cold snap. Wondering if anyone knows what happened over there - something in the water?	Other
The pond on the southern edge of Bryan Park is significantly drained and stagnant. The fountain has not run at all this spring or summer and has filled with weeds. There is a stench of raw sewage that surrounds the area of the pond. This pond alone could produce enough mosquitoes to plague all of Bellevue, Ginter Park and Battery Park. It is a shame that such a beautiful water feature has been neglected, and considering continued public access to the park, it should be kept in good working order.	Other
The gates to the road access around Bryan Park are being left open again this season and there continue to be individuals parking along the wooded areas toward the back of the Park and sitting in their vehicles starting at 6:30 in the morning.  Based on the history of this Park, this needs to be addressed.  Unauthorized vehicles are not allowed past the soccer field parking area, but these individuals continue to be in this area loitering or watching.  This is a family park.	Other
This season, unlike last Spring, the gates at Joseph Bryan Park have been opened and the paved areas have become not only a magnet for folks who drive through faster than necessary but also some men who back their cars in shady spots, wear sunglasses and hats, and appear to loiter. This starts in the morning hours before work, all day during the weekend, and in the evenings during the week. Given the history of the issues that this has created in the past, it seems like it might be necessary to close the gates to all vehicles except those belonging to the City or the Police. Children play in the Park and it just does not seem safe to assume that these individuals sitting in cars apparently not making any normal use of the Park are there for any good reason.

It would be unsafe for park users to approach these individuals and ask them what they are doing. 

Please address this issue.	Other

I am a sometime bicycle commuter, and my way to work takes me across Mayo's Bridge, continuing south on Hull Street to Belt Boulevard. The road on the bridge is in terrible shape, and the storm drain grates are so poorly installed that I have to avoid them by riding further in the traffic lane than I ordinarily would. This wouldn't be a huge problem if drivers obeyed the speed limit going across the bridge. Unfortunately, they don't. I routinely observe drivers doing 40 or 50 miles per hour across the bridge. It's completely unsafe, both for those of us observing the laws AND the people who flout them. Riding across the Mayo Bridge in that kind of traffic can be a terrifying experience. I don't believe it should be. Please do something permanent to get drivers to observe the speed limit (and why not reduce the speed limit across the bridge to 25, as it is Downtown and in Manchester). Please don't wait for another bicycle injury or fatality to address this and other safety issues.	Other

I couldn't even navigate my dog out of all of the broken glass to get him across safely. There was tons of garbage especially in front of the Mayo Island area and someone's been living and throwing garbage right under the bridge which is in plain view when walking across. I was surprised this area was not better maintained as it is currently well travelled and will become more so as the Manchester area develops.  Please send a crew to get this area cleaned.  My guess is that it hasn't been cleaned in a long long time.  Thank you.	Trash/Bulk Pick-ups

A warrant for the arrest of Richmond Police Officer has recently been issued by the Magistrate's Office for an alleged assault against a unarmed security guard. 



This incident occurred around 2:30am this past Sunday morning in a parking deck located at 1001 Haxall Point in Richmond.  This off-duty police officer was leaving the Black Finn Restaurant and was at the parking deck's booth to pay parking fees when he became involved in an irate argument with the property's security officers about amount of the fees.  It is claimed that the off-duty officer opened his vehicle's door pinning a security officer against the parking booth.  The officer said he had to force the door shut to free himself.  Upon doing so, this off-duty officer (vehicle's driver), shouted, "Nigger, I will shoot your @#$%", then got out of the car and grabbed the unarmed security officer's chest.  An occupant from the passenger side then exited the vehicle and displayed a Richmond Police badge.  It is believed, soon after the assault, this second individual left the scene.  The assaulted security claimed his assailant smelled heavily of alcohol.

It is believed the off-duty officer who is claimed to have assaulted the unarmed security officer may have been previously disciplined by the department after having been indirectly involved in a similar incident in Shockoe Bottom where there was an attempt to cover up an assault by another off-duty Richmond Police Officer(s).



I fear this recent incident outside the Black Finn will not be diligently investigated internally nor managed by the Richmond Police Department.  Seems some Richmond Police Officers historically engage in the consumption of alcohol while off-duty and lose their ability and desire to maintain the level of professionalism expected by the citizens of Richmond.  The Richmond Police Department needs to command this same expectation of their officers.	Other
There is an unsecured access door in the road that was not bolted back down. It rocks open when cars drive over it, and bangs open and shut violently (and loudly) during strong wind. 
Anyone curious can easily open up the panel, and accidentally fall 25' to land on sewer equipment - very dangerous.
Please re-secure access panel.

There is a homeless guy(s) living on the riverside of the concrete wall adjacent to the Dominion Power sub-station.   It is a cesspool of filth including what are probably numerous stolen and broken bicycles.  The area needs to be cleaned up as it is unsanitary. This is accessible from Brown's Island via walking on the pipeline.	Illegal Dumping
Please consider paving this gravel area as it is a trip hazard to pedestrians transitioning from the end of the mural section of the canal walk to the asphalt area below.  This area will receive a lot of additional foot traffic during the bike races and would be in the city's best interest to make this safer for all of our guests.	Other

This has been previously reported but it was never fixed.  At the pipeline overlook and the floodwall opening, there is constant standing water in the roadway.  Right now it is ice and a hazard to cars and people.  A small drainage swale is needed to drain the water away from this area.	Other

Hello, I have an issue in my neighborhood. The house at 620 Little Neck Rd, 23452 has a blue tarp across the whole roof. It covers the entire roof. It's been on the roof for approximately a month. The house is currently for sale. It's creating a eyesore in the neighborhood. It wouldn't be a big deal for a couple of days or weeks but it's been on approximately a month. Is there anything that you can do to assist with this neighborhood eyesore? We appreciate any assistance provided by the city?  If you have any additional questions, please contact me. Thanks.	Other

LIghts along Kingston Dr are out, making it dangerous to walk at night.	Street Light
Kingston Dr is a cut through street to Kingston Elementary and the back of Kings Grant. The foot traffic in the morning and afternoons contains a high volume of children traveling to and from the school and bus stops. Kinnston Dr also experiences a high volume of cars driving quickly causing the children to move to the grass or gutters of the street to avoid being hit. Even without exceeding the 25mph speed limit it is extremely dangerous for two cars in opposite directions to pass at the same time while children are walking in the street. The speed needs to be reduced during school hours, enforced, or side walks need to provide safer paths for the children.	Other Roadway Issues

I had a package stolen off my porch on 2/6 ( the same day a hypodermic needle was on my steps).  There was a man walking up and down the street that day, my neighbor went out and asked what he was doing- waiting for a ride was his answer. We were not home when this occurred. Yesterday, 3/6, I had 3 packages stolen. A man with a large backpack was seen on Front Street again yesterday. Front Street residents beware if you are having anything delivered. The window of time that the packages are stolen is less than 2 hours from delivery.  I live in the block between Pine and Chatham Street.	Policing Issue

Why are trucks allowed to double park on Elm Street during rush hour traffic? This happens nearly every day, sometimes with delivery trucks on both sides of the street such that a three lane road becomes single file. Traffic is often snarled up back to the Shops at Yale and the intersecting streets due to cars unintentionally 'blocking the box'. Please enforce parking laws!	Parking Violation/Abandoned Auto

Why is the person charged with enforcing the parking laws egregiously violating then? This is an unattended double parked vehicle. There was an open, proper parking space right in front of it.
