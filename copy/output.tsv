In July 2016, I had an email exchange with Brian Dehner about a broken stormwater drain and subsequent erosion of Hudnall Lane and surrounding ground areas. 

We're appreciate that ground erosion repairs were made and that Hudnall is on the street repair list for 2017-2018.

1-Will repair of the broken storm drain and installation of proper drainage be within the scope of work for the street repair project?  
2-Is there an expected start & end time for the Hudnall work?

Thank you very much for your attention to this, and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter further.

I take my kids to Dixie Heights. My route is to take Lyndale, make a left on to Dixie. We get a green arrow to turn left and cars try to go but kids do not obey the traffic signs and walk.  We barely get any cars thru turning left and I have seen kids come running thru the crosswalk when we have a green arrow. Kids may get hit. I see this everyday. The other lights at the Dudley intersection have the green arrows at the end of the light cycle. Wondering if the cycle of the green arrow at Lyndale can be changed to the end as well to prevent any accidents and allow cars to turn left with no kids walking.	Traffic Sign Missing or Needs Repair

I take exit 7 every day to go to work, like thousands of others.  A few weeks ago, I got side swiped from a car in a hit and run (police report filed).  But even before my accident, and many times since then, I've seen the same exact thing almost happen to many others because there are no lanes painted on the road.  There are faded arrows painted but during busy hours, cars are covering them.  There are signs overhead by the lights, but no one seems to look there.  To my understanding, there are 4 lanes:  far left turns left onto Marginal, middle two lanes go straight on Franklin, and the far right turns right onto Marginal.  Having dotted lines going through the intersection to show which lanes go straight would prevent the issue tremendously.  The same thing happens up at the Whole Foods intersection, but not quite as bad.  Please fix this!!  I'm sure I'm not the only one that doesn't want to risk getting my car hit every time I come into work.  With the amount of tourists driving around here nowadays, not everyone knows how this area works.  Thank you!!	Paint Street Lines

This is the third of fourth time we've had to post about this road. Its been neglected and there are huge potholes that fill with water during every storm. Now that it is winter time, they are creating huge sheets of ice. It is a safety concern and I fear that someone will fall or get into a car accident. Back in July someone assessed the road and said it was going to be fixed by the winter time for this very reason. Now it is December and the problem hasn't been fixed. This problem needs to be addressed before someone really hurts themselves.	Road Maintenance
The whole street especially the left side has several holes that are getting deeper and deeper. There is tons of standing water every time it rains and for days after. Cars keep hydroplaning and the water is attracting large amounts of mosquitoes and bugs. I reported this a few months ago and they came to patch the biggest hole, and said they were returning to fix it and never did. It needs to be done before winter or else the whole street will have layers of ice again.	Road Maintenance

There is a guard rail on that side of Wellham Ave. We told Mr. Murphy that we are asking for this entrance for a driveway because my wife Carmen Johanna Santiago is a handicapped person.

The speed limit on wellham ave is 30. People do atleast 40+ down this residential road. I have almost been hit several time backing into my driveway because people are speeding and not paying attention. I see people pass people on the wrong side of the road because they aren't going fast enough. I see people use Wellham as a drag strip. I even have video camera infront of my house and you can see how fast people are going. Something needs to be done to maintain the speed on this road before a child gets hit, since this is a residential neighborhood. There is a school and several parks off Wellham so there are away kids by this road. The county shouldn't wait until someone gets hurt or killed before they act, they need to do something about the speed sooner then later.	Road Maintenance

7876 Mansion House Crossing has garbage piled up alongside the residence. This causing our neighborhood to see rats, mice, opossums and raccoons. We have never had this problem before. They also park motor vehicles on their front lawn. The tan vehicle pictured does not run. Finally they have a large camper that does not move parked and taking up several parking spaces. Isn’t there a county ordinance that makes people move there vehicles every 48 hours. This residence is a nusience in our neighborhood and is bringing down our property values. I have attached photos and would appreciate any assistance you can offer. Thank you very very much.	Trash, Garbage or Refuse
The road of Mansion House Xing/ Notely Road has become a freeway filled with speeders and people who disobey the stop signage who use this road as a cut through to Duvall highway which makes a residential road a HIGHWAY in itself. Since installing surveillance cameras I have witnessed on a daily basis 900-1000 motorist passing my house throughout all hours of day and night. Thought there are some safe drivers, people abuse this area and excessively speed, tailgate, and perform moving violations to avoid being on the main roads because they're either high/ drunk or a combination of both. I've lived here for 30 years and this road has gotten progressively worse. There are children, runners, and families of all ages who use the cross walks and I fear one day will be RAN DOWN because everyone uses this road as a highway. 

By installing speed humps at a modest height, as they have installed on Notely and the other side of Chesterfield this will help to prevent the excessive speed motorists are freely abusing on a daily basis. I find it disgusting that I have to put up with people using the straightway of my road as a 1320 drag strip to show off how loud their supped up car goes to impress NO ONE. It is ridiculous that every time we as a community try to have speed humps and awareness to the police we are shut down for NO GOOD REASON! I am embarrassed for district 3 leaders who have ignored our calls for help for years - THIS NEEDS TO STOP BEFORE SOMEONE DIES JUST BACKING OUT OF THEIR HOUSE TRYING TO GO TO THE STORE!

DESCRIPTION
Speed Bumps. The lack of are ridiculous, Cars and trucks are speeding over twice the speed limit all day long. Police should set up radar traps.

Please forward to the police id you are unable to improve the roadway with proper speed bumps that will actually encourage vehicles to slow down.	Road Maintenance

An RV and a trash bin has been parked along the street for months and months. These vehicles are not allowed to be parked on this street and is a distraction to vehicles.  I have had close calls with cars backing out of driveway near this obstacles because they can not see and just back into traffic. Also the obstacles are blocking people and children walking or crossing the street.  Please have these vehicles removed. Can not see tags as they are blocked by a vehicle that bumps up to the back.

Back in May, Comcast had to cut a hole in a sidealk to inspect a power line they struck while installing cable. They cut into the sidewalk that runs along the street at the foot of my driveway. They put in a temporary fix, which was later ripped up by BGE as they needed to investigate the damage and repsir the power line. BGE poured asphalt over the hole and said they would inform the county of the temporary fix so that it could be fixed correctly later. 

But the recent rains have started to wear down the patch job and I'm afraid the hole may open up again. Just yesterday I noticed some of the asphalt is starting to break away from their attempt to cover the hole. The hole is on the sidewalk at the foot of my driveway, and people and cars are driving over it daily. It is just asphalt poured over a rather deep hole with BGE spray painted on it in white paint.

I was wondering if there is a timeframe or plan on the county coming out to repair the sidewalk correctly before an accident happens and someone gets hurt. I'm hoping someone from the county can come out and take a look and let us know what is going to be done. We are just concerned that someone may get hurt and will try to hold us accountable for the damages due to it's proximity to our house. Thank you.	Sidewalks

I am writing to inform you of a possible violation of the Critical Area Program. 


I live in the neighborhood known as Winchester on the Severn.  Most of the homes here are technically in Annapolis/Anne Arundel County, and all of the homes are in the Critical Area.


Recently one of my neighbors hired a landscaping company to “clear cut” the backside hill of his property.  Dozens of trees were cut down and all of the bushes and native plants were cut back completely (pictures below).  Virtually nothing was left on the hill and recent rains have caused erosion of soil down to the Severn River, which is approximately 600 feet away.  Numerous tree stumps are still evident on the hill.


I believe the property address is 220 Riverside Drive, although the hill that was clear cut is on the backside of the main property.


I am not sure if the property owner contacted you for prior approval of this action, if so fine.  However, I would be shocked if the Critical Area Program administrators would approve such a major clear cutting.


I respectfully request your review of this situation as remediation measures might need to be taken.

As noted in request #7409259, the poles at this intersection serve absolutely no purpose other than to make turning more difficult. Parking at that corner is already illegal due to the fire hydrant located there.

Please at least explain why they are there if they are going to remain. What problem are they solving?	Traffic Signs

What is the purpose of the 3 poles that were placed on Dairy Farm, right where cars turn in from Waugh Chapel Road? It can't be for parking reasons, as there is a fire hydrant there making parking illegal anyway.

They've been knocked down at least once, and I predict they will continue to be knocked down. Please just remove them.	Traffic Signs
Over the last few weeks, white bumpers have been installed on Dairy Farm Road at intersection with Waugh Chapel- it is very dangerous now for vehicles attempting a left turn from Dairy Farm as vehicle turning from Waugh Chapel needs to negotiate a turn on a very narrow lane and today I was almost hit by a vehicle turning left from Waugh Chapel when they over corrected.

I live at 6867 Baltimore Annapolis. We have a driveway and we have to use it because the house across the street from us has about 7 cars, most of which are huge trucks and trailers. As you can see from the picture we are unable to see up the street because of all the cars/ trailers/ work vans that are parked on the side of the road. It is almost impossible to see traffic coming up B and A blvd. This is a huge safety concern and the weird thing is all 4 or 5 houses going in that direction have driveways that could easily fit there vechicles.

There needs to be another stop sign where Breckenridge Way meets Breckenridge Circle - in the Waterford community off of Riva road - to stop traffic on Breckenridge Way where it meets the stop sign on Breckenridge Circle.  People continually do twice the posted 30 MPH speed limit on Breckenridge Way and the people stopped at Breckenridge Circle have a real issue pulling out.  It's like trying to merge onto an express way from a dead stop.  I live on the corner and have witnessed one accident and a lot of near misses.  A simple stop sign would force the oncoming traffic to stop and allow for a safer environment for everyone.  It's also where the bus drops kids from school.  There have been near misses with children too.  I've alerted the Waterford HOA as well.  With the rate of speed people travel on Breckenridge Way an accident and a law suit is inevitable.

Thanks for considering this.	Traffic Signs

About six months ago the streetlight bulb on this corner was changed from a soft light to a glaring white almost strobe light that shines directly into the windows of my house and through all the light clocking curtains making it essentially daylight in all our bedrooms at night.

I would like to request an analysis of the trees in the Cambridge Commons park to remove the ones that are too weak to survive the weather.

On October 4, I was walking in the Cambridge Commons park alongside Mass Ave, and in the corner closest towards Porter Square a huge branch of a tree fell. Had it fallen on my direction, I would have been badly hurt.
On October 17, with the heavy winds, the same tree lost more of its upper branches, and so did the tree beside it. These are very big branches and they will end up hurting someone.

I live on the corner of Maplewood Ave and Russell St. Every weekend in the summer, especially late at night, there are drivers that go up and down Russell St. at extremely high speeds--they appear to me to be going down the hill at 50 mph. I'm worried that a child or pet will be hurt or killed by these drivers. The drivers on Maplewood have stop signs, but the drivers on Russell don't. The problem is not only that the cars go so fast on the hill, but I've also seen several cars pull out from Maplewood onto Russell when cars were coming because they assumed it was a four-way stop, and it's not. I've lived here for a year and seen more than one near-miss because of that. 

There are many, many kids and and outdoor pets in this neighborhood, and I'm worried that there will be tragedy outside my house. Is this the appropriate place to voice concern, or is there another place I can go to voice it? I believe this intersection should be a four-way stop, and the neighbors I've talked to feel similarly. For what it's worth, I also saw this intersection reported by a reader in the Marlborough Patch online. Has there ever been a study of the traffic in this intersection? It seems like putting a four-way stop at this intersection just makes sense for the safety of all.	Traffic Signs

Hall Avenue has multiple deep potholes. These are primarily caused by the heavy trucks and government services vehicles e.g. heavy USPS trucks that use Hall Ave rather than go through the nightmare of the square's traffic pattern. These trucks often exceed the residential speed limit. Medford contacts have told us verbally that Hall Avenue is a private road and that potholes are a responsibility of the residents. But if this is true, why are there no signs and no speed or access enforcement? There should be NO vehicles over 2 axles or 6000 lbs gross weight here if that's the case. Holding these few residents accountable to fix an issue caused by the insane traffic pattern a few streets over is insanity. The resolution should be for the city to fix the road, put in proper private road / no thru traffic signage, enforce private access and speed limit on this road to prevent further damage to our private way. The government of Medford and the USPS are using this road heavily and with heavy vehicles and should be held accountable to fix.	Pothole

This intersection requires a SECOND 'safe' stopping zone for traffic entering from both Church and Orchard Streets. Achieved with a second Stop Sign, and corresponding Stop Line painted on pavement, along with a short run of Double Yellow Line leading up to Stop Line from Orchard Street entrance. This would encourage a safer approach for vehicles attempting to enter onto Common St and discourage those vehicles entering into this intersection from Orchard and Church Streets from having to stop, as they do now, dead in the middle of the intersection in 'no man's land', as they attempt to seek a safe merge window. The addition of 2 signs at the Church St entrance to intersection, 1) "Left and Right Turn Only" (Left & Right arrows) and, 2) "Oncoming Traffic Does Not Stop", would also help to deter these vehicles from going straight into 'no man's land' area.

Would it  make sense to replace the "green light" traffic signals (solid green) with (solid green) "arrow signals" (turn right and turn left onto Belmont St.) for "Northbound" Warren Ave, traffic ?

Vehicles constantly speeding on Old Jarvis Ave while using it as a cut-through. Speed limit is 20, but vehicles easily doing 40 and sometimes higher. Many pedestrians on the road with no sidewalks. 3 way stop at Old Jarvis and Bassett would help and/or a speed hump at that intersection. Traffic study would also help. Easy place to catch speeders.

Vehicles constantly speeding down Old Jarvis as a cut-through. They are well over the speed limit and often have loud music playing.

Every day a PVTA bus traveling west from Rte. 141 toward HCC is going at an excessive speed. this is a safety issue, and a quality issue since they are so loud going at that speed. Would appreciate it if official contact concerning this issue with PVTA might be more effective. 
There is police monitoring on Jarvis but the effectiveness is questionable. An hour sitting in plane view near the Loomis house only slows down most drivers for the time he sits there.
I do have solutions to this problem:
-Put in speed humps
-Put in permanent speed indicators such as the one on Rte 5. ( when the temporary speed monitor was used last year I noticed a difference in the speed of vehicles)
-sit on Lacus dr. Across from old Jarvis where you are less obvious and give speeding tickets to commercial and non commercial drivers.	Non-emergency Policing Issues

Construction noise at this site has been constant and in violation of the City’s good neighbor policy since commencement of this project. Noise from the site can be regularly heard as early as 6am and as late as 11:30pm. Generally noise from the site extends into the evening daily (past 7pm). Most recently Saturday (10/15/16) I was awoken by loud beeping coming from this site at 6:45am. This particular noise sounds like the beeping produced by a truck or bus backing up, however the beeping continues all day without a break. This is not the first time the constant beeping has been present, but it was particularly disturbing on this occasion because I had the rare opportunity to sleep in.  I understand that vehicles engaged in such work require safety features like beeping to alert those nearby of danger. However, the beeping never stops, so its purpose certainly cannot be to alert those in the area of danger. The beep is gratuitous at best.  I understand the same developers are seeking to develop two adjacent parcels to this site. This is very concerning given the lack of respect the developers and their contractors have shown to the neighborhood during the course of this current project by permitting loud, noisy, and intrusive work to completed at all of hours of the day, often 7 days a week.

I often drive past this location on the way to drop off my children for their various activities.  There is usually a scruffy A-frame type sign on the flowerbed by the side of the road, upon which is handwritten a silly message, obviously by the owner of the furniture store.  Until yesterday it was just the fact that it looked out of place and untidy.  However, for the past 2 days that I have driven past the handwritten message has included offensive language, albeit in abbreviated form (please refer to the attached picture).  It may seem petty to report this but I simply feel it is not appropriate for this to be visible to the public from the roadside, especially when many children are in vehicles at this time of year.  I'm sure I am not the only parent to feel this way about it so thought I should speak up.

Almost all streetlight issues are closed by Mr. Trask with an answer that the vendor has been notified and now with the latest answer that the lights are going to LEDs over the next few weeks.  Can you please explain the process?  We report a light out.  Trask says the vendor is notified.  And the issue is closed.  Does the vendor own the light, does the town?  How does the resident and/or the town know when the light is actually fixed.  Or how long should they wait before reopening the issue - saying the light isn't fixed? Does the vendor have a required time window that it MUST fix it - if it has some type of contract with the Town.

Please do not answer this with the town is changing to LEDs.  We know that - you have already told us that.  What we want to know is in general how is the fix process suppose to work?

I don’t mind them being there temporarily to pick up their children from the school, but they left their cars, so I could not ask them to move.

Even though school is out and the parking lot is empty, cars continue to pack in the play yard and basketball court. This is a fenced in area and should be used for recreation and not parking. It makes it tough to want to play with the kids without having to run around the cars.

The South elementary school yard is littered with beer cans and nip bottles  from underage drinking, not to mention the trashed bicycle hanging in a tree. I know the police have been "moving along" kids that they find in the school yard after hours. I think a little firmer action is required. Something needs to be done so that parents of these slobs sit up and take notice. 

If parents had to pick their kids up at the police station accompanied by a fine, it might solve the problem better than moving the kids along to stagger home from congregating somewhere else.

This is a safety hazard and a disgrace to our town and parents of these kids should be ashamed.	School Department

Hi, 
I chose the category Pothole because I wanted my concern to go to the town and there was no other "street" category.
There is a major blind spot issue when turning onto Otis St. from Pleasant St. during the morning commute (in my case during 8:15-8:22 am).  Cars park on the right side of the street up to the corner of Otis and Pleasant St. and it causes not only a major blind spot, but it makes the street one-way before even turning down it. There have been times where I have nearly gotten hit turning onto Otis St. because cars were coming down the street and I couldn't see them due to the cars parking so close to the corner of Otis and Pleasant St. 
Could you please have someone look into this? Maybe they could just limit how close you can park to the corner of the two streets by putting up a "No Parking Here to Corner" sign.
I have attached 1 picture of the parking situation (apparently I'm not able to attach more than that).

Thank you!	Pothole
Central Street in recent years has increasingly become a cut through street for traffic in morning rush hour on Route 62 heading toward West Concord and Route 2. When traffic begins to back up at the Pine St/Rte 62 light, drivers turn right off 62 onto Brown St and then left Central St where they then gun their engines and drive at very high speeds down Central. I live at 273 Central St and for the last 20 minutes dozens of cars have been doing this. It is worst between 8-9 am. This is a neighborhood of many children walking and biking to school and the high speeds of these cut through drivers is dangerous and disruptive. It would help if the Concord police would periodically be a visible presence near the Brown St/Central St intersection or on Brown near Rte 62 to deter cut through driving and ticket those who are speeding. Also it would help to put up signs prohibiting cut through traffic between 7:30 -9:30 am and posting speed limit at 20 mph. I've lived in this house for many years and this problem didn't exist until several years ago. Please help.	Other
