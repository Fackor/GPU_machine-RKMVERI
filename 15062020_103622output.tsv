After several calls to the police, the previous 'tenants' of the newest hobo hotspot in town had moved on by Sunday afternoon. By Monday morning (today), the junk they left behind was being repurposed by a new occupant (wearing a red shirt), who was busy scouring the surrounding area for more junk as I passed, having evidently previously been moving the road traffic barrier up towards the fence and setting up a 'living area' behind it.

HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY, ALONG WITH ALL OF HIS JUNK.

I knew the leftover junk would attract more and sure enough it did in no time at all. This must be nipped in the bud before we have to go through the same dance of reporting and re-reporting as in other areas.

This always happens—a hobo moves in with minimal stuff, a day later they've collected more stuff to build a more substantial shelter attached to some fixture (fence, light pole, etc), a day after that stolen goods begin appearing (bikes, chairs from nearby Spark, residents' doormats), along with dirty trash dumped onto the sidewalk. Soon after that, they invite friends and the encampment grows.

This growth brings with it a greater sense of confidence and they start doing things like shouting at and intimidating my wife and children as they walk home.

Speaking of which, my wife and children need to walk past this everyday and a child who is not yet fully innoculated is obviously at more considerable risk. It was tiring enough nipping the previous problem in the bud, and it took far too long to see a result. Now we've just moved right onto the next problem.

ENFORCE THE LAW AND REMOVE THIS SEEDLING OF AN ENCAMPMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE IT GROWS OUT OF CONTROL.

If you do not, this is yet another area which will rapidly go downhill.	Encampment

Hi~

At the end of Idlewood Drive, there are some apartments on the other side of the fence. 

There is a hole in the fence and it is causing a lot of foot traffic from the end of Idlewood Drive. 

Many residents have expressed concern with this hole in the fence (or opening) and would like the apartment owners to close up this hole, permanently. 

Many of us have been back there, but cannot see where the hole / opening is.	Private Property Issue

There is a lot of harried activity with trucks full of soil laying out what looks like foundation at the end of Pinehurst Drive & West Woodbury, at end of street where I live. I have called the City of East Point's Development Office to inquire and they simply told me, "I Don't know what it is." The trucks barrel down West Woodbury AND Pinehust in excess of street 25 MPH and are quite rude to the neighbood residents who have to drive the roads which are bad in the first place. Can we please, 1.) Be notified with what they are doing and please find out what they're doing? 2.) Please let Engineers on site and Truckers of Soil bringing soil (in a hurry) to slow down? We have children who live and play in the streets. There are zero sidewalks and zero street drainage which is making for a big mess. Thank you.	Other

1.) Pinehurst Drive (off of Connolly) lacks ANY STORM DRAINAGE on the entire street. Subsequently, when it rains, it pours. The water is saturating MY property as I'm at the bottom of the street towards Mayberry. I have asked the Director of Public Works, as well as spoken with an Assistant at the City Manager's Office near 6 months ago (2019) for help. We require street drainage for water, flooding, the water breaks that pour down towards my property;

2.) Mayberry Street off of Pinehurst Drive is strewn with garbage (e.g., dumped mattresses, clothing, garbage);

3.) H-154 West entrance ramp is Strewn with garbage, papers, water bottles, food trash. Can we please clean up our streets?

About a year or 2 ago, the street was painted, but at that time, the painters forgot to paint in one of the lines up to the point where cars heading south on Stanton were supposed to stop.  Now, the cars are not far up enough for traffic turning West (from Stanton on to the Delowe Connector) to turn.  It causes a HUGE backup for cars turning off of the 166 Connector and turning South on to Stanton and the surrounding streets.  NOW cars are starting to run the light.  It's becoming a huge issue, just because the paint job in the street wasn't finished.	Traffic or Street Sign Issue

At 4:45 PM on 12/11/19, I was proceeding on Martling Ave after waiting at a red light at Martling/Slosson. After a few seconds, my rearview mirror was filled with the bright blue-white headlights of a truck aggressively tailgating me. I was going 25-30 mph. Suddenly the truck crossed the double yellow line into opposite traffic and pulled up alongside me. When I honked, the tow truck cut in front of me and slammed on their brakes to threaten me into an accident. After a few seconds, the truck proceeded, at 10 mph. I took a photo of the license plate when we reached the red light at Martling/Clove Rd. When we made the right turn onto Clove, the tow truck continued to travel at 10 mph on purpose. There was traffic behind me, so I honked. The truck slammed on brakes again, refusing to move for several seconds. The car behind me chose to use the bike lane/shoulder to go around us. When I tried to do the same, the truck revved its engine and wouldn't let me get past. When we reached the light at Clove/Broadway, the car that was behind me and went around was at the red light. I slowed for the red light, knowing that there's no way I would get around the tow truck without getting into a collision. The tow truck sped past the car in front, cut in front, and then turned off its lights to drive dark. It turns out the truck was also going the same direction I was, on Bard (I was far behind the truck at this point due to waiting to make the left turn on Bard) to Forest. On Forest, the tow truck driver narrowly missed hitting a pedestrian and quickly took the right turn onto Metropolitan Ave. The truck is red, and I didn't catch the name of the company that actually owns the truck so I can't complain directly to them. There is a AAA logo across the rear window as well, so I'm issuing a complaint to them as well for this driver's conduct. It was dangerous and absolutely uncalled for. I was terrified. The license plate number is 23186TT.	Other

Old unregistered truck that was towed to this wooded location and green stickered by the police department including the wooded area is becoming an eye sore for the neighborhood.

On the front lawn of 40 South Road (I think it’s 40; it’s the tan house with green shutters, next door to #38 South Road) there has been a broken down vehicle (a white Mercedes) for at least a year. It looks terrible most likely does not run, as no one has driven it in all of the months it’s been sitting there. Can something be done about this? I drive by often and the residents of that house also seem to park most of their working vehicles on the lawn as well. It brings down the property values of homes in the neighborhood and it’s unfair. I believe the white Mercedes got a police ticket once (earlier in 2015), but then someone just slapped a “for sale” sign on the car and continued to leave it there.	Abandoned/Unregistered Vehicles

The fire hydrant on the corner of South Rd and Oakridge Dr is blocked with snow again. It was just cleared YESTERDAY and the Rafferity Garage guys that plow this road just blocked it again.

Someone needs to place a phone call to the owner of that garage. This is happening every time they plow.	Other
At the entrance to the Enfield Public Library there is a rectangular shaped (large) light on the same pole as the street light I believe. This large light keeps coming turning on and off approx. every 5-7 minutes; stays on for perhaps 30 -45 seconds and turns off again. The light appears to be malfunctioning. I don't know who owns or controls this light but it has got to be costing extra money to run it if it keeps going on and off. Please see if you can do something with this issue. Thanks.   p.s. Personally I don't see how that light is necessary anyway. There is a streetlight right there that is working fine. Seems like a waste of money to me.	Streetlight

Three times in the past 3 weeks I've witnessed people driving out of the library parking lot in the wrong direction. They are going out through the entrance. They don't seem to realize it is all One Way once you come in through the entrance. In one instance I was almost hit head on as I was coming in and an elderly couple were driving (too fast) out...coming right at me. I stopped; laid on the horn and waived my hand out the window to get them to stop. I told them it was one way and they were going in the wrong direction...they turned around. I think it's become necessary to put something up that will grab people's attention. Thanks for looking into this.	Public Safety Concerns (Police)

The contractor has encroached on the properties on both sides of the 10’ path leading back to Lot 50.  On the side with Lot 51 the mud & rock are being pushed under the silt fence which has also been pushed over.  On the side with Lot 49, the silt fence was at one time completely torn out, now it was replaced and is over the lot line by 6-12 inches.  There are two places on Lot 51 with standing water after the rain that never happened before.  Damage to the wood fence of Lot 49 has occurred twice.  They also took it upon themselves to remove the cover to the cable box by the street and bury the cable connections under the rock for the drive to the site rather than having the utility company move it properly.  This eventually caused cables to be cut and service disconnected.	Grading Violation

South Shore Bus Service Taken Away

Hi Jimmy:
With the new Staten Island bus routes and schedules planned for later this month. I would like to know why the South Shore of the Island has been forgotten in this latest restructure. As you know I work for a major media company in Manhattan and my stop neat my home is Woodrow Road & Arden Ave. I usually arrive at the location between 1:15 AM and 1:30 AM. Now with the new route plan. The last stop is the Eltingville Transit Center. I am by no means leaving new vehicle in a lot loaded with homeless people sleeping in the center and outside as well as drug activity in the area all the time.

Check the MTA ridership. There are many, many people who take this line to get to ANNADALE, ARDEN HGTS and HUGUENOT. 

They cannot stop this service. 
Hope you can be of assistance in this issue.

Look forward to hearing from you.	MTA Bus Complaint

A car failed to negotiate the curve at an entrance to Pardee Seawall Park. It took out a number of the barrier posts designed to stop cars from entering the park. There is now a wide open area that will allow the next out of control vehicle to continue into the park unimpeded. The barrier posts need to be replaced ASAP before another driver loses control on that curve.	Parks Request
Two days ago, my wife and I spent over an hour of our time picking up and removing garbage from the rock beach at the end of the Pardee seawall.  This morning, just two days later we walk to the end of the seawall to find that someone (or a group of people/kids) had flipped over the cement garbage container and dumped EVERYTHING (a huge overflowing garbage can's worth) into the water!!  This is the same garbage can that we put our bags of collected trash into just two days earlier... and could now SEE them back floating in the water! Along with just a TON of other trash... the whole beach is totally covered! 

Honestly I've had ENOUGH of this (and we see it every summer)!  As a community, we should be OUTRAGED! I do not understand how someone could do this with no thought to what it does to RUIN this beautiful area we get to live in and need to work together to protect. Most of all we should be concerned over the generational impacts it will have on the quality of the water and wildlife in our area...  Enjoy fishing on the new pier? Or kayaking along the shoreline? Or swimming at Lighthouse Point? Now dump a can of garbage on it.

As I see it, three things need to happen:

1. The Parks Department NEEDS to increase its pickup and collection of trash.  We've seen other posts showing the constant overflowing of trash in the park's containers and on the new fishing pier. We walk on the seawall every day, and just yesterday we were commenting on how all the trash cans were overflowing once again. We can't continue letting these bins become targets for vandals/people who have nothing better to do with their time than ruin good things for everyone else.  I also will be reporting this on SeeClickFix.

2.  We need to increase our presence of policing, whether that's more NHPD in the Cove at night (which probably won't happen) or simply having more neighbors keeping a watch on our streets and parks and stepping up to say something! I myself stopped a couple of teenagers who were destroying property on that same beach just two days ago (the same day we initially picked up the garbage). Maybe we should think about forming a more organized neighborhood watch at this point?

3. Parents need to talk to their children and teens about the costs and effects of vandalism and hold them accountable to cleaning up their messes. I don't know for a fact who dumped the garbage into the water, but I can tell you we have seen a couple of groups of teens in the park late at night all this week (mostly getting high on the same benches that are right next to that knocked over garbage can).  This behavior needs to be stopped. If it were my kid, I would want to know... and I can tell you, they would be down there cleaning it up right now.

I know everyone on here loves Morris Cove as much as we do... we have to do everything we can to protect it.	Illegal Dumping

A light at this location and 4 additional lights to the south have been on during the day.  One day I was looking at them to see for sure if they were on during the day, and they all the sudden went off.  Then a subsequent day, they were on during the day again.  Duke Energy says they are not their lights.  I had thought you worked out a deal where the city and Duke Energy communicate about these things so they are reported one time, but instead Duke called me to tell me these are not their lights (even though I believe they are on their website map).

When we have food delivered to our home, we never use the utensils given to us. If we could opt out, we would. I have a drawer filled with items I'll never use and can't recycle and didn't even want in the first place. I'm not saying ban utensils completely, but give customers I way to opt out. I'm also writing to delivery services to see if they can add a feature to their programs. Thanks for your time.	Other

I am requesting that DOT install speed bumps on Hamilton Street NE between South Dakota Ave NE AND 7th Street NE.  Cars regularly speed at extremely high speeds as they travel from South Dakota Ave NE to Eastern Ave NE using Hamilton St NE, especially during evening rush hour and in the evening.  I have two infant children (8.5 month olds) and it is extremely unsafe to buckle them in and remove their car seats from the car with cars speeding both ways.  Once they begin walking I know this fear and danger will be compounded.  There are also many other young children and elderly people living on this block that are also in danger of being hit by speeding cars directly in front of their homes.

There are speed bumps on Hamilton St NE between 7th and 8th St NE and cars make an effort to slow down. In addition, there are speed bumps on neighboring Ingraham street, which sees far less car traffic, and on Galloway, a busy throughfare street.  Both speed bump installations have decreased speeding and keep residents safe.  I request that our block of Hamilton Street NE be afforded the same opportunity for safety.  Thank you for your consideration.	Traffic Safety Investigation

Loose gravel coming up through recently repaired roads in Fall of 2018: The roads in our HOA were recently done in the Fall of 2018. And while I greatly appreciate them being patched and re-sealed I believe the final coat was either not done or was not done correctly, possibly to thin. Immediately following the completion of our community roads gravel was coming up. At times it sounds like you are driving on a gravel road instead of one recently sealed. Black Horse Ranch community is separated into three sections. I would like to meet with someone from Pima County Road Maintenance in person to review the roads within our HOA community and try to understand what is happening to roads that Pima County/Cholla Pavement just resealed. 
This is my second request. I sent photo's previously and was told it was dirt from construction in a cul-de-sac off of E Canter Rd and Golder Ranch Rd. If it was happening in that area only then I would agree. Unfortunately, is happening in all three of the sections. In the N Twin Lakes Dr section, N Gwynns Run DR section and the N Rugged Lark Dr section. I did contact Cholla pavement first and was told I would need to contact Pima County. And while the photo attached was taken off of E Wilds Rd and N Gwynns Run Dr it does not really matter as you can take this same photo throughout our community and they would all look the same.

Despite Public Works digging a slight trench in my front yard during the second week of January, 2016 (as part of an effort to regrade Grove Hill), I am once again having drainage problems. The trench was not deep enough to allow my yard to drain adequately; hence, rainwater builds up quickly and pushes the water back toward my house filling up my septic system. I would appreciate a re-digging of the ditch -- hopefully a bit deeper to help alleviate the problem. Thank you so much for your attention to this matter! -- Karen Davis	Ditch Maintenance

A year or so ago, the city came through and did some pipe work under the raod corners.  They finished up one day and put down what I'd assumed was a temporary patch over the hole.  But that same cheap fill is still there, anx at this point it's crumbled into dirt.  I've a two year old.  This is NOT helpful.  Please send someone to finally fill the hole properly.  Thanks.

We've got a brick alley between 5th and 6th streets N, running N-S.  It's got ruts literally a foot deep all along it.  The rits are so deep that I can't get my car across them amd into our driveway without scraping the bottom of the car up.  It also doesn't drain, so all rainy season, there are foot-deep puddles the while length of the street.  Trying to get into a car with a baby in your hand in ankle deep water has gotten old.  Please, can you send someone to resurface/level this alley?	Alley Blading/Smoothing
a street light at this corner is heavily blocking by low tree branches that make the streetlight almost pointless. It is very difficult to see while walking on the sidewalks due to the darkness.

I have reported this MANY times and the lights are still on during the day.  It was explained that there is a sensor that turns them on and offer, and that maybe the trees are blocking the light causing them to be on during the day, etc. etc. etc.  What that person seems to not understand is that IF they lights are on during a sunny day, SOMETHING is wrong.  The senor can't be working properly or it is being interfered with and it should be corrected.  Why on earth is someone saying there is no problem over and over again?  

Once again.  As simple as possible:  If the lights are on during a bright, sunny day, SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY!  

If the city just does not care and is not going to fix this, than just say that instead of saying it is working properly.	City Park Maintenance

Bush at the corner of 6th Avenue north and 6th street north is right on the corner.  It blocks drivers views and it also overhangs the sidewalk and it has thorns so it's hazardous to walk by as well.

The recent hurricane knocked over our neighbor's tree.  It's laying against the garage of another neighbor and over our house.   The problem is, it's also laying directly on top of a live power line, pushing it down toward my roof.  My two neighbors despise one another and flat out won't pay to take the tree down.  (We're willing to pay 1/3 the cost, but neither of the others is.)  The tree is a fire hazard as is.  How can I get at least the part touching the power lines removed, to keep my own house safe, without depending on either idiot neighbor?  Duke Energy claims trees touching power lines are not their business.   Is this really true?	Tree Trimming/Removal

The crosswalk signal at the NE corner of the intersection (Patchen/Williston Rds) is not operating. When the crosswalk button is pushed, we hear 'wait'....but no amount of waiting is going to result in the ability to cross Williston or Patchen Rd.

The crosswalk signal is not working and everyone who uses this #1 bus stop is aware that it has not worked since the pole was struck by a vehicle. That's a very, very long time.

The only way to safely cross over to the NW corner (with a #12 bus stop and a working crosswalk signal) is to walk down Patchen Road to be a safe distance from vehicles turning off Williston Road and then cautiously crossing the street before backtracking to the intersection.

I'll feel more comfortable if this report remains 'open' until somebody has actually looked into it and a repair has been scheduled/made. This is a long overdue issue that many bus ridesr/pedestrians at this intersection are talking about.	Signals

Just south of 3868 Wedgefield Circle (just south of Hilton Dr), Decatur, the County dug up a pipe, filled in the hole and left the red dirt/mud with a very bad pothole. Just north of the same 3868 Wedgefield Circle address, another pipe was dug up a year ago and a metal plate was installed. A crew finally fixed that pothole last week, however, they dragged the big metal plate to the north of that hole and left it there. They could have put that plate over the pothole to the south and solved two problems with one expensive visit by several County trucks to Wedgefield Cir. It doesn't make sense. Cars are having to swerve at the pothole AND at the metal plate to keep from damaging their cars.	Other

Improper operation of traffic signal at corner of Whitney and Hawthorne avenues
Sometimes this traffic light stays green on Hawthorne for far too long and even when no car approaches on it and nobody presses the pedestrian signal. This isn't traffic calming; it just causes wasting of fuel and could make some drivers run the red light. The behavior is erratic; sometimes the signal operates properly. I'll try to post a photo of the traffic backup.	General Issues
This traffic light sometimes cycles with approximately equal green time on each street even when no cars approach on Hawthorne and there is of course much more traffic on Whitney. When it does, traffic can back up for over 2 blocks as the picture shows. The problem is exacerbated because on-street parking there reduces traffic on Whitney to one lane. This behavior is erratic; sometimes it behaves properly, staying green on Whitney until a vehicle approaches on Hawthorne. The strange behavior does nothing to improve safety and only causes vehicles to waste fuel.	General Issues
There has been no street sign on this corner for several years now. Even with the wide availability of navigation systems, signs are essential for those unfamiliar with the neighborhood.	General Issues

How much longer is the city going to leave the stretch of Main St. heading east between Poe's Pub and the Wharf unmarked? The intersection of Main St. and Williamsburg Rd. is already a problem area as folks turning left onto Williamsburg Rd. have a bad habit of starting their turn early or "rounding it off". I have had a couple semi close calls there in the past. It has been nearly a month since this stretch of road was repaved. It is high time the road markings were redone. This spot is already an accident waiting to happen. The lack of road markings just makes it that much worse. I would also suggest a "TURN HERE" sign on the pavement for the folks turning left on Williamsburg Rd.	Other
The north bound lane of Wiliamsburg Road right after you pass 31st and just before you make the turn onto Main (by what would have been the stop light and bus stop) there are pot holes. Two have been filled although the fill is shallow, but the uneven dip and hole of another pothole that is there still is disruptive to the traffic flow because you are trying to avoid the wall there to the right and with the pot hole, your car will go over into the other lane when you hit it or when other cars attempt to avoid it. It is a public safety threat and risk..  One is large enough to do serious damage to a tire and wheel and if you lose control to harm a persons  walking and running up Libby HIll.	Pothole

At the intersection of 13th & U street NW heading north bound, there needs to be roadway markings that indicate who is to turn left, go straight, or turn right. Many times drivers "take up" all the lanes because it's difficult to tell who is going where. Is the driver going to turn left - then I should get in the right lane, or is the driver going strraight - then I should get behind him, or is the driver going to turn right, then I don't want to get behind him. NO ONE uses their signal, you figure it out when the light turns green and the cars move. Clear markings will help alliviate the problems. It looks like there is plenty of room for two lanes, one for a left turn and one for straight or turn right. JUST LIKE THE SOUTH BOUND side.	Roadway Striping / Markings

We are hoping that we can get that done in the near future as it is a very dark road for walking, security etc. We do realize there are other pending and probably more important tasks at hand but we hold out hope.

There is a stop sign at this location that is facing southbound but is on the other side of an intersection. It is confusing exactly where to stop since if you stop exactly where the sign is, you have already passed/are in the middle of the intersection. The signs should be moved so it's clear exactly who should stop for whom and where. 

By the way, the exact location of the stop sign is directly east of Arby's, where one of the entrances to Arby's, a road leading from Old Wake Forest Rd to Capital Blvd, and a third road that goes behind the strip mall intersect.	Signals / Signs
The stop sign by the Arby's on Capital Boulevard seems to be placed incorrectly. The stop sign is placed in the middle of an intersection of two roads, so stopping in front of the stop sign leaves you in the intersection.

Dead raccoon in bike lane on side of road beside the school	Other
Since the closure of the fitness dome, trucks, I assume from neighboring businesses, have begun parking on both sides of Bridle Gate drive. I am not sure why this has happened since the dome closed since it seems Parking would have been more of an issue when it was open and had customers parking there. The vehicles parked on both sides of the road are mostly large trucks, some with attached trailers that have other vehicles on top of the trailers. This makes for poor sight lines to see oncoming traffic when trying to turn on to Bridle Gate drive from Bridle Trails, Bridle Ct or the Highway 6 frontage road. It has also caused near head on collisions when vehicles are traveling between these parked cars toward the frontage road and another vehicle turns on to Bridle Gate drive from the frontage road at a high rate of speed.

There are dust clouds during wind gusts blown from the construction site across Rock Prairie Rd. between Old Rock Prairie Rd and Stonebrook Dr.
These clouds are very much like a sand storm. Not only that they contaminate the surrounding houses, but they also create health hazard (breathing) and driving hazards (decreased visibility).

I hope that something can be done about this.

There is a road construction going on and off for many weeks on Faulkner Dr. (It's slowly moving from Woodcreek Dr. toward Frost Dr.).

This has created numerous problems in the area, most, if not all due to the lack of diligence on the construction crew.
1. First, for many weeks there were loose gravel and debris on Woodcreek Dr., several hundred yards (all the way to Waterford Dr.) from the actual construction site. So, as you drive on Woodcreek, you get all that garbage beating on the bottom of the car.
To be fair, they did clean up at the end of the day, but driving day time was like driving through a construction site, even though it was some 3 blocks away.

2. They do not post signs that the road is close (and at times it is effectively closed). 
E.g. today, I was driving from Woodcreek Dr. toward Frost Dr., and the crew was working between Finney Cir and Frost Dr. One have of the pavement was lifted and blocked by the crew and the machinery, while the other half was freshly laid, and still sticky. One of the crew members was some 50-70 ft. in front of the site, giving gestures to slow down.
He directed me to drive through that still sticky pavement. I just had new tires installed 3 days ago, and I that staff ruins tires. I had to drive back to Stonebrook Dr., Rock Prairie Rd. and back to Bird Pond Rd.
Because of that, my kid was late for the sports class.

3. This construction has been going for enormous amount of time. The heavy machinery is coming all the time and they are not always the most courteous or careful. E.g. this morning, I had a dump truck that was tailgating my car, while I was driving on Woodcreek Dr. at the speed limit (30 mph). 

4. Further down, the pavement was removed from Frost Dr. (between Faulkner and Bird Pond Dr.) and no work was going there for weeks.

Could you please,
a) make sure that there is a proper signage and diversion of traffic when the work is in effect, and improve overall safety
b) post the period of the road work so that people are aware (how many months?)
c) complete the work on Frost Dr. ASAP?	Other

How many unsafe cars are on the street because of this STICKER Company.  This car at 9206 Shadowcrest Drive has not moved for over 8 months.

When cars are turning right from 100 Boyett Street onto University Drive, drivers leaving from 306 University Dr. from Hallabaloo Hall (turning left onto University) are disregarding the right away for the cars turning right on green lights and are almost hitting cars in the right lane.  When they make their left hand turn they are cutting across sharply into the furthest right hand lane.  On several occasions I have witnessed near accidents, especially at heavy traffic peak hours (rush hour times).  Can an advance green be put on the traffic signal turning left from Hullabaloo Hall?

I visited Dat Dog at 101 Church Ave, Suite 1200, College Station Texas  77840 on August 17, 2019 at approximately 2 pm - 3 pm.  Due to there being limited parking in front of the building we parked in the paid parking lot down the street.  As we were leaving the restaurant, I walked out onto the sidewalk to make my way to the parking lot.  There is a 2-tier sidewalk right out front. The surface closest to the building is one level and then the surface closest to the road has a gradual slope to it.  I did not see the 2nd layer and stepped off and broke my right foot.  Has this happened before?  This has got to be a hazard.  I do not drink, I can see well and it was clear weather but this was not something I could see as I walked.  Thank you for your response.

There are several locations along the length of Welsh Avenue (I notice it most when northbound) where tree branches are hanging down into the bike lane.  This forces cyclists to take the car lane, which is upsetting to drivers and a hazard.  I will create issues for places I particularly noticed (this is location 1), but it is probably most efficient if the entire length of Welsh Avenue is checked for this maintenance need.  Thank you!

I previously reported 4 instances of branches in the bike lane along Welsh Avenue.  One instance was resolved quickly and I commented as such (I think probably the gas station management itself took care of that one).  The other three instances were closed without any apparent effort to resolve them and are now archived so I cannot reopen them.  I will ask (again) that you please make the bike lanes safe to travel in by trimming the trees that have branches that force bikes into the car lanes.  The remaining three locations are near the intersections of Welsh and -Honeysuckle, -San Mario, and -Westchester.  If you can't find the branches I reference, please comment as such rather than closing the issue without addressing it.  I will be happy to make a point of stopping along my commute to take photos if necessary.	Other

Dockless bike on Victoria near Eagle.	Dockless Bike Share
1) My understanding is the city had to relocate the bike lane/trail from Lick Creek to Eagle Ave to Longmire Dr.   The bike lanes have now been recently painted on Eagle Ave with the center double yellow line.   Vehicles are parking in the bike lane on Eagle Ave near Victoria and on Eagle Ave across from school.    Will signs be added later restricting vehicles from parking on Eagle Ave in the bike lanes?  
2) Notice for about 3 weeks now during the early morning hours with the joggers (5:30am) in the neighborhood, there must be a street light circuit out because not all the street lights are shining especially on Eagle Ave near the school between Alexandria and the curve at Creekside Circle.  This is currently the undeveloped area and it is dark on both sides of Eagle.   Looks like every other street light is out.
Thanks!	Other
Victoria Ave has a lot of traffic on it and there are many elementary kids crossing it every morning and afternoon to get to school.   A cross walk, a crossing guard and/or maybe a speed bump would be helpful.   There is a lot of speeding on Victoria, exacerbating the problem.

I would like to write a formal complaint about our experience with Housing Inspector Wayne Grenard. My husband and I are a young couple and bought a historic home in Ferguson to renovate into our dream home. During the first few months we decided to get a fence. Wayne made the whole process extremely difficult for us. We had to jump through many hoops to get the permits. We used Chesterfield Fencing Company and they said Wayne requested items from them they have never been asked about for a residential fence. He was very rude to me over the phone and on the day we were supposed to get the fence installed Wayne did not approve it so the whole project had to be pushed back a week. I had already taken off work the day of the project so I missed out on a day of pay. Wayne was very rude to me throughout the process so I handed the situation over to my husband. My husband went up to the City Hall to talk to Wayne and he was very rude to him as well. After the fence finally got installed my father was at our home one day and Wayne came over because he left a measuring stick at our home. He was very confrontational towards my dad while asking for the stick. I have talked to many neighbors and all have had similar issues with Wayne. It is very discouraging that a city that would like to rebuild and attract young families would knowingly keep employing someone who continuously deters young families from wanting to invest in their homes. When I drive around my neighborhood there are houses falling apart and abandoned. Its hard to believe under those circumstances that Wayne would have time to hassle residents who are installing a $10,000 fence. Overall my experience was so poor I felt compelled to share it with Wayne's supervisors. Thanks	Helping A Neighbor

This issue has been reported on here for 2 years. It is however reported under an incorrect house number. The issues are at 917 N Broad St and it is appalling that the city has found no resolution in 2 years.  I do not comprehend how you issue violations and offer excuses of the owner cannot afford to fix any of the problems. The city offers several options to its residents. Trash pickup, compost site, spring and fall pickup... The list goes on and on. Laws and ordinances were not established for city workers to enforce them at their own discretion. It is a simple system, follow the laws and ordinances or be found in violation and progress from there if notice of violations are ignored.  Saying the owner cannot afford to fix the issues is absurd.  Issue the tickets and then follow up and continue to issue tickets until they are resolved.  The fairgrounds just did a recycle on tires.  Yet over 40 tires are stacked in their yard. STOP condoning laziness. When the city had spring clean up for free, these people couldn't move some of the rubbish 10 feet to the curb for a free service?  Maybe it is a conflict of interest to have the code enforcer being supervised by an over worked city prosecutor.  Is the code enforcer pushing the issues that need to addressed or ignoring issues to lighten the case load for our city attorney?	Blight

Street - Traffic Signal Concern 
Location and Description of the problem 
Tree foliage blocks a school zone flashing light for Irving School.  Drivers who turn from 20th onto Eastbound Van Dorn are unable to see the flashing school zone light located east of Irving School on the north side of Van Dorn, well past 22nd Street (about 2300 Van Dorn). PLEASE inspect this issue when the light is flashing: drive north on 20th Street to the intersection with Van Dorn.  Turn right/East.  Look for the flashing light and note how far you have to travel before it is visible (probably you will be in the block East of the school, almost entirely past the school zone).  As long as trees have foliage, this school zone flashing light is entirely ineffective.  It would be great to have this issue addressed for the safety of the Irving School students.  Thank you very much.	Traffic Signal Concern / Signal Burned Out

This residence is channeling water from the property out across the sidewalk. There's a large patch that's never dry. It's growing algae or mold or something, and killing the grass on the other side of the walkway. It's unpleasant to walk through and it's been a problem for months, and it will be a hazard when winter comes. There's been a similar issue here before which was fixed, but something must have "backed up."	Residential Property Maintenance

The SIM1 service has been very bad for commuters going home. It has led to 20-minute waits and overcrowded buses. There are four SIM4 buses for every SIM1.

South Shore Bus Service Taken Away

Hi Jimmy:
With the new Staten Island bus routes and schedules planned for later this month. I would like to know why the South Shore of the Island has been forgotten in this latest restructure. As you know I work for a major media company in Manhattan and my stop neat my home is Woodrow Road & Arden Ave. I usually arrive at the location between 1:15 AM and 1:30 AM. Now with the new route plan. The last stop is the Eltingville Transit Center. I am by no means leaving new vehicle in a lot loaded with homeless people sleeping in the center and outside as well as drug activity in the area all the time.

Check the MTA ridership. There are many, many people who take this line to get to ANNADALE, ARDEN HGTS and HUGUENOT. 

They cannot stop this service. 
Hope you can be of assistance in this issue.

Look forward to hearing from you.	MTA Bus Complaint

Good morning,
My driveway, along with my 3 neighbors has been plowed in. It is about 4-5 feet of snow and not something that can be dug out with a shovel.

Grass is growing along curbs and the cracks of the sidewalks around this building particularly on Greenwood Avenue and Wickham Street.  Contractors cut the grass on the property, but have yet to get rid of the grass growing on the concrete sidewalk and curbs.  It needs a type of weed killer.

Right in front of my driveway. This pothole is getting bigger every day.

I've reported this pothole multiple times before in last couple months - case 2382389 and 2448629.

I would like the thank the Public Works Dept. for their prompt response yesterday, 10/01/2015, in draining the water from Ocean View Ave.  However, I would like to point out that until the 'pumps' (if there are any) have been fixed, the flood problem will continue. The roadway was flooded again within one hour after you left yesterday. Here is a picture of the area this morning.	Roadway Flooded
The ditches and the culverts on Horn Point Road are all clogged and do not allow the water to drain/flow.  Anytime it rains or we get the slightest Southern wind the water covers the street from ditch to ditch.  I was told at the meeting held at the Senior Center on 10/04/18 that there is no money in the budget to clean the ditches but that seems ridiculous to me so I hope that I was told some incorrect information. When I first moved to Horn Point in 2012 there was only an occasional flooding.  Now it seems like it is a constant occurrence and a dry road is an occasional occurrence.  We need the city's help out here!  we really need our ditches and culverts cleaned out so there is a place for the water to flow through so that it is not in our streets and our yards and our houses!!  And we need you to stop pumping Asheville Park's flooding problem into Back Bay and making it a problem for us.  We cannot handle any more water out here.	Stormdrain Maintenance
The entire street, from the beginning to the end of Horn Point Road, is crumbling.  I have called it potholes but the situation is much worse than that.  The whole street is deteriorating and each time it rains and/or floods we lose a little more of our street into the ditches.	Pothole
A concerned homeowner walking his dog over the past week or so  noted the below street lights burned out/inoperative: 1824 Fury Way, N1111 XL93, 1872/1876 Champion Circle (between mailboxes, no pole #) 1825/1829 Champion Circle (cycles on, then out, no pole #) 1853/1857 Champion Circle (cycles on, then out, no pole #) 1769 Champion Circle (by traffic circle) N1211 DJ14 Also, in front of 1720 Beauty Way, there is overgrown shrubbery blocking the sidewalk. At 1972 Champion Circle, which I believe is unoccupied, the back porch has some sort of wooden cover which has been blown down. I'm not sure if this is something that we as an association should be concerned with, other than it looks bad, as if the home has been deserted.	Street Light
They just stripped my street for new pavement.  In front of the storm drain between 5633 and 5629 Quarterpath Gate, there is a 2 inch whole that opens to a large hole.  This should probably be filled in before they cover it up when they pave the street.	Other Roadway Issues
Want to let you know that one of the homeowners had a tree cut down and half of it almost completely blocks the drainage canal just downstream of Ludlow Drive.  It will completely back up the canal during heavy rain and will catch/block every bit of litter that floats down the canal.  The remainder of the tree is laying on the bank which will restrict city access down the canal as well. Simpson Tree Service cut it down, but instead of dropping it on the bank, he let half of it fall directly into the canal.  Simpson said he was only paid to cut it, not remove it as the homeowner said he would do it.  It has been there for a month now!
 You can best see the problem from Ludlow Drive as it passes over the canal just off Pissarro Drive.  The owner lives on Latique Circle.

At the intersection of Historic Forbis and North Church (N-S) and Summit Avenue (E-W) only the vehicles on the North end tend to follow their lanes and turn properly.  At all the other ends of this intersection, traffic commonly signals to turn or gets into a dedicated turning lane and then change their minds at the last minute.

The danger to pedestrians is clear because they can be caught in the traffic with a car bearing down on them regardless of the lights or driver signals.

I once observed this with Jeremiah from Engineering and Inspections in the past months as he surveyed for the Summit Avenue Streetscapes project at this intersection.  Because I observed this over the past several months, I wanted to report this dangerous intersection now before someone gets hurt.

I feel that the lanes and street markings are adequate, but drivers refuse to follow them anyway.  Perhaps the City can consider adding some of those round half-baseball lane markers to remind drivers to stay committed to their own signalling and the dedicated turning lanes they are keeping in.
A little jolt and bump from crossing those markers may help.	Other

I’m not sure what it takes to get something done. I know this isn’t a big item on your plate but I first corresponded with you in July. It’s now October. The problem is worse now than it was in July. Cyclists are now swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt from the driveway. It’s in the Midnight Pass/Higel curve. Eventually someone will get hurt. Cars routinely cut that corner with their right side tires in the bike lane – I know all too well as I was knocked off my bike by one right in that corner as I was riding in the bike lane. 
 
Combine cars with their tires in the bike lane with cyclists swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt and you have a big accident waiting to happen.
 
Please take some action on this.	Road or Bridge Issue

Many surrounding neighbors have been complaining for a long time and now something needs to be done. The residents have 2 large dogs that they leave out for long periods of time, and they bark most of the time. It often occurs before 8am and after 10pm, and during the weekends it is very obnoxious as well. Please give them some kind of warning now, with the intent that it could lead to a fine if it continues. The owners don't even attempt to stop it, and often encourage it if they see they are barking at other animals.	Other
The entire stretch of road on NE 2nd avenue is littered with potholes from 60th to 40th street. It is a huge hazard, I already dipped into a pothole on my scooter, fell onto the road and suffered injuries. There are also NO LANES painted onto the road on either side, so there are no lanes separating the north and south flow of traffic nor are there lanes separating traffic on the same side. People are constantly swerving across the road as there are no lanes and are often driving onto the opposite side of the road. This is INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS!! Please fix!!	Traffic Flow & Congestion

Good morning.  After waking up today and starting to get my young children ready to school, I realized that I now live on a race track.

Exterior Site Lighting Glare - Nuisance - Light Trespass 04-14-2014

To Whom It May Concern:

There is an unshielded spotlight located at 12 Holiday Lane, Enfield, Connecticut 06082 [Owners: KARAKLA CLARENCE J + MARY K] which is causing lighting glare and trespasses across the neighborhood property lines during most nights. This ongoing nuisance disturbs the peace and tranquility and degrades the quality of life that negatively impacts nearby residents.

The spotlight is mounted on the garage side of the house and should be hooded as well as pointed down and to not reflect off of any building materials, so that the lens is not visible and the light cast does not project outside the property line in order to meet the code.

This fixture creates a strong night time light glare in my backyard and house windows at night.
Absolutely, there is no reason in the world that this spotlight should remain on continuously from dust until dawn which it has on many occasions for a very long time. I strongly believe this practice has to stop because it really borders on harassment.

Installation of this lighting fixture was initiated long after the establishment of the following ordinance:

Enfield Town Code
Section 7.10.6 Outdoor Lighting.
All external illumination shall be directed or shielded in such a manner that the source (bulb, tube, etc.) of light will not be visible from any street or from any adjoining property. No light shall be directed outside the lot where it originates. All lighting shall be shielded or otherwise designed to provide down lighting so as to minimize night glare.

Therefore, I am asking that you please take the appropriate action to bring this lighting violation into compliance so that we can all sleep in peace.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.	Zoning Code Violation
Miss use of pedestrian crossing street sign.

All these years the mill has been here making the wooden cable reels and storing the assembled ones on their property on Oak St on both sides of Randolph St stacked 4 to 5 high in a large area until they are needed and then transported out to the various places that have purchased them.
Has any one ever thought of the possibility of them falling over?  They could fall due to the high winds, rain or snow or just because they were not balanced when stacked.  They could fall over in to their surroundings which may be a passing vehicle or person walking by or a worker in the lot.
Should there be a tall fence to support the height and amount of reels?   Should they just not be stacked as high?
It would be nice if some one could check in to this even though nothing has happened all of these years - but they did have a fire not too long ago if you recall.	Zoning Code Violation

Zoning Violation – Rear Yard Spotlights Project Beyond Property Line – 10 Holiday Lane
At 10 Holiday Lane there are motion sensor duel spotlights positioned at the rear of the house of which the lighting projects beyond the property line and lights up the surrounding properties [yards and buildings] along Longview Road at all hours of most nights for the longest time now.
This situation is not reasonable or acceptable for a residential area. It maybe alright for parking lots or airports.
A few things need to change for this lighting to become into full compliance with the Enfield zoning lighting ordinance such as:
1.	The spotlights must be adjusted so that the main light cast does not project beyond the owner’s property line.
2.	The spotlights should be shielded [hooded] in such a manner so that they do not glare outwards against other surrounding dwellings which is different than the main cast of light.
3.	The spotlights sensor(s) be adjusted to an extent as much as possible so that it reduces the amount of times the lights are tripped on and off again at multiple times.
4.	The spotlights do not run all night long nor most hours of every night.
5.	The spotlights are pointed so that the lights do not reflect against a bright building surface that they are mounted on which can also broadcast any nuisance light glare outwards at even a wider angle.
Therefore, it is requested that zoning enforcement serve notice to have these changes made as soon as possible.
Thank You.	Zoning Code Violation

Backyard spotlights behind 10 Holiday Lane which are on most nights of any week have bulbs that are not shielded that is in violation of:

No light shall be directed outside the lot where it originates. All lighting shall be shielded or otherwise designed to provide down lighting so as to minimize night glare.
Please have the resident add shields around the bulbs to comply with the code and have them stop running the lights at all hours on most nights of every week.	Zoning Code Violation

This is the second time for this complaint.
The first time after this issue was reported and acted upon, conditions improved quite a bit but not entirely for awhile, gradually returning back to where it started.
Every time the wind blows, branches sway, raindrops, snow and night falls, the lights turn on and project the glare past the property line on through to other surrounding homes which in effect, when occurring repeatedly, essentially makes this also a breach of peace in an R33 Zone.

The original message is repeated below with some clarifications and additions:

3. The spotlights sensor(s) be eliminated or adjusted to such an extent as much as possible so that it greatly reduces the amount of times the lights are tripped on and off again at multiple times, in which this is extremely annoying.

4. The spotlights do not run continuously all night long nor most hours of every night.

5. The spotlights are pointed downwards in a manner so that the lights do not reflect against a bright building surface that they are mounted onto which can also broadcast any nuisance light glare outwards at even a wider angle.

Therefore, it is requested that zoning enforcement serve notice to have these changes made as soon as possible and follow up to insure compliance is met on the above 5 listed points as well as report the completed progress made by the homeowner from Zoning Enforcement inspection before closing the issue on this website.

The sidewalks along Amerige Park have not been cleared of snow all winter.

At 8PM we heard trucks and they were ripping up the pavement. Talked to a guy said that's when the DCR wanted it done. I told the guy this was unacceptable and asked hadn't we been notified. I said no and he said that the residents should have been notified. Yet another thing got to call DCR and find someone who will never do anything about it. The least the city could do for it's residents on the Fellsway is deal directly with DCR, or rather, should do. Enough already.	Other

Hello,

There is a rat, possibly more, coming from the house that is in back of mine (the house is a pinkish color) on Maynard Street. I noticed this yesterday 5/11 am and in the afternoon and again today 5/12 all morning long (and it continues). This rat goes between the fence panels (the house on Maynard Street that borders my backyard has a tree that pushes my fence panels apart) and under another fence panel to my next door neighbors yard. And back again to the pinkish colored house . I’ve let my next door neighbors know but I don’t feel comfortable going to a complete strangers house on another street. It is definitely not a mouse. Far too big for a mouse. This could be a serious health issue for myself and my kids. One of my children has disabilities that may not allow him to recognize the danger of rats in our backyard . I have my own pest control company coming to set traps this week but someone from the city should have a conversation with the residents  on Maynard Street and let them know what is going on . I don’t have any trash or garbage in my yard. It is always secured in the front part of my property. Your attention to this issue is much appreciated . Thank you	Animal - Pets or Wildlife

Still the same situation going on at this address for years (look at archived complaints).  After the owner was notified last year the garbage cans were pushed on the front lawn for about a month before reappearing on the street again, I just did not had the time to reopen the issue before. Today Wednesday  I took a picture: the overflowing garbage cans are as usual blocking the sidewalk and the collection day is not until Monday.
This owner has ample space to store the garbage cans on his private property on the side of his parking lot.

Repeated paint smell/nail polish like smell in the Cross & School Street Area. Typically about 2PM in the afternoon. Called BOH before and BOH investigated and determined it was most likely coming from Westboro Auto Body. This smell does not smell safe for anyone's health especially with having young children. It is strong enough that you do not want to remain outside or open windows. Noted: 12/2/13, 10/15/13, 10/11/13. However, this has been going on much longer.	Other

Our next door neighbor and the neighbor behind us have been piling brush up a few feet from our property line in the back and on the side.  You can't see into the woods and I believe it could be a fire hazard.  Also, it looks awful.  I read that brush can not be placed within 40 feet of street or neighbor's yard.  Is this enforced?

People next to us and behind us cut down trees and have been piling brush all around our home within about 15 feet of our property line and in one on our property line.  It's looks terrible and per the recycle website says they can not do this within 40 feet and brush can't be higher than 2 feet.  These rules have definitely been broken in this case.

I have lived on South Washington since 1999 and since then the traffic on the street has gotten much heavier. But the real issue is the speeding. The amount of traffic exceeding the speed limit is staggering. At least 5-10 times a day there are people on motorcycles and in cars with little regard for safety going unbelievably fast. As a resident of the street and part of a family who are avid walkers I am terrified that someone is going to be killed before anything is done. This is a residential street. Please enforce the law of the speed limit on this street. A speed camera is the best solution and if not that, a consistent police presence is a must.

I am last house on a cul de sac. 2 issues, first is that every snow storm the contractor plows do not plow literally within 12 feet of my driveway. I don't feel I should have to shovel the street to get access to my driveway. Last night I di flag a plow driver and had him plow closer to my driveway. Secondly, all the snow from the circle is piled up in front of the only hydrant. I can see the hydrant, but my concern is the fire department would have issues the way the snow is now. Can a backhoe come and just move the snow piled in front of the hydrant? Thanks...	Snow/Ice on Street

To the plow driver in the red truck, thank you for being the first one to completely plow the cul de sac on Berrywood Lane. For years I have had to shovel, not just my driveway, but 3-6 feet of the street as well because every plow driver approaches the circle incorrectly. The correct way is to get on the left side of the street entering the circle. This allows the driver to get close to my driveway. If they stick to the right side of the street, they can't get any closer than 3-6 feet of my driveway without having to circle around multiple times, which they never do. Again, thank you red truck driver!	Other - City Issues

It appears that the left turn signal for traffic heading south on 27 and turning left onto 135 is no longer turning on directly following the use of the walk signal.  If there is no walk signal requested the left signal works as always, but if a walk signal is requested, then the left signal is skipped.  This is creating traffic back ups in the center and potentially safety hazards.  I noticed this yesterday and thought it was a fluke but just sat through 4 lights just before 9 am due to constant use of the walk signal creating skipping of the left turn signal.  Please restore this important signal.	Traffic Signal

Folks, we have to stop allowing cars to turn left from Pond St. onto Rt. 27 or at least during the busy times of day. It is dangerous and makes no sense for cars to turn left there. Alternate solutions - on Pond St., divert them to Rt. 135 before hand. Secondly, have them turn right onto Common st., left on Park street, and they are on their way. Cars turning left onto Rt. 27 is dangerous for everyone involved. Also, if cars are trying to turn right, from Pond St. onto Rt. 27, but are stuck behind someone turning right, they legit have to wait sometimes 4-6 minutes, per turning left being dangerous and weird. Please fix this critical issue. Respectfully, JW	Other

I have had an ongoing issue with a local pet store in Okotoks Alberta, and it has been in the news before, as well as local papers. I have contacted the PETA website, as well as the SPCA, have made numerous posts online, and have had protests about this place. It is called Exotic Animal House, and it needs to be shut down, or at least exploited to the point of removing the animals from his care. This place is a straight puppy mill, and I have tons of proof including messages from other people, pictures, and personal experiences. We got a dog from there a year ago, (Before it was a puppy mill) and she had contracted PARVO from being there, and the owner had denied the whole thing, refused to pay for her vet bills, and had lied on her paperwork regarding her first vet check, she was in the hospital for weeks hanging onto dear life, and they wouldn't even bat an eye. We have spent over $3,000 trying to keep her alive, and with the help of people from gofundme.com we were able to pay off half of her bills, and thankfully save her life. ANYWAYS, I was in there today "checking" on the store, and i have to say i am absolutely disgusted. Here is my facebook post word for word, and I wish I was able to include photos just to prove how disgusting this place is.

As everyone knows how much I HATE Exotic Animal House, and this place has gone downhill since I was there last. They are literally a puppy mill. All other animals and reptiles are being neglected because of the puppies. There are rows and rows and rows of cages of puppies with 6 or 7 puppies per cage with no blankets to protect their paws, and they are laying in their own feces. One kitten looks so sickly and like it could die any day now. They have parrots living with budgies and rabbits living with Guinea pigs all to make room for the poor puppies. The fish tanks are all nasty and look like they haven't been cleaned ever. I used to work here back when it was family owned and everyone was supportive and the place was the best place in the world. And now it's literally a place from a horror movie. Please share my post and spread the word, help me try and exploit this place more. This will not be my first attempt, and it will not be my last."

If you are able to do anything to exploit this place and help me shut it down, i would be eternally grateful. Thank you for your time, and kind heartedness. Coming from one passionate animal lover, to hopefully another.	Animal Control

Truck destroyed two utility poles and gouged out the ditch and shoulder of road in this region.  Road had just been recently repaved.

Since this road receives a considerable amount of water through this ditch, it will eventually undermine the shoulder at this location and ice\water will also degrade the damaged pavement at this location very quickly.

The same homeless man has been living under this bridge for over a year. He collects trash and urine in a jug, and it always smells like urine, feces, and body odor. He always throws trash, rotten food, and other debris (mattress, shopping carts, chairs) onto the sidewalk. Recently he obtained a futon couch which he has folded out to block the sidewalk. I don't think a wheelchair could get by. Regardless, I know that dozens of people have to walk that way to BART from condo buildings on third street and this has been a nuisance for over a year. My neighbors agree with me and have complained before. We would like all of the trash removed and the man told to leave because he returns every day with even more trash, which has also led to the apprearance of four additional trash cans under the freeway here.

Yesterday, for example, my ticket showed that I had entered $.60 but it only gave me $.50 worth of time. Using these kiosks is like playing roulette!	Other

	Final Water Reading
It was reported to me by a business owner in Greenfield in my role as a City Councilor (and I saw first hand) the following issue.  There are 2 properties located just prior to the rotary leaving (or entering town). one is the Mobil Gas Station on one side and on the other side the Quality Inn, both locations have not been mowed this season and both are eye sores for the town as out of town visitors are treated to these problem area as they enter Greenfield.  Overgrown and uncared for property can pose a possible health risk as this type of property draws vermin as well as being a deterrent for visitors wanting to either shop or eat in our town.  Is there any way these property owners can be contacted or be held accountable to care for these visual problem areas?


I thank you in advance for your response on this issue :)

Our utilities seem to be working ok, but this is REALLY bothering me. Can you help me find out if someone from GRU was at our house this week and if they did something (what/why)?

The tenants in apartment 1230 building 12, have been blowing marijuana smoke through the vents for 5 and a half months and they have many complaints against them from several tenants who even saw them smoking in the breezeway and blowing it through my door multiple times. Both are supposed to be illegal. The lease says that the building is supposed to be non-smoking and I have suffered lung pain and terrible dizziness migraine and headaches from the smoke! The office assistant manager told me that they were scared to get sued and didn't want to transfer them to another apartment or evict them. This even though they are violating their lease! They were given many police reports and the police said it was a civil issue and they needed to be able to catch them in the act and so on. The next door neighbor in apartment 1221 has even taken a picture of him smoking marijuana.
The mail tenant upstairs is not even on the lease and provided a fake ID to the police and no more identification was requested from him which I find really disturbing because he stalked my daughter and I twice when we were on our way to the car and she is only 10. Secondly he confessed to somebody that was a relative of one of the other tenants that he does smoke marijuana and it makes him another person. This is probably why he was making violent banging noises at all hours of the night even though the lease says that quiet time is from 10 p.m. to 8 am. For 5 and 1/2 months the office has done nothing to transfer them!	Code Enforcement

I'm not sure if it is intentional, but I sat through three light cycles in the turn lane traveling East on Nebraska Ave trying to turn left to head North on Belcher Rd. I was taking my daughter to school and she was late because we sat at this light for 7 minutes. The turn signal does not turn to flashing yellow due to the presence of crossing guards at this intersection. Also, the duration of the light when it does turn green is a maximum of 5 seconds. Because of these issues, this turn lane becomes unnecessarily backed up. I'm sure you can understand the frustration this causes and I hope that there is a reasonable  solution to help improve this intersection. Thank you.	Traffic Signal Issue

It is used to have a sign to not park on the road side of the 4714 lake Charles way north,kenneth city,33709.  A property owner from the cul de sal removed it long time ago.  I understand a pizza delivery guy to park for 2 minutes but not a car sometimes all day even with a Illinois liscence plate that has not been changed to florida for months.  The issue is for the owner of  both properties 4715 and 4714 to drive their vehicles out of their circular driveways.  It becomes a safety issue for 4715, the vehicle does not have enough spaces to turn left when a car is parked the other side of the street.  The same issue with 4714, if a car parked on either side, it becomes a safety issue to turn or to back off.  I'm asking for the sign to be restored from the corner of the cul de sac to not park on the address 'even' like it used to be.  And honestly, the other side should not be allowed too.

Residential community being used for place of business. We have a resident that brings vehicles into our condo community for storage, maintenance and sales. This issue has been reported to our association. The vehicles will be removed for a short time, and then more vehicles are brought into the parking lot later. This resident has been seen working on these cars, and also attempting to sell these cars in the community. This issue has been ongoing for a year. The condo association has rules in place to protect residents against the storage of commercial vehicles, solicitation, and trespassing. We are hoping the city can assist the residents in removing this type of business from the community.	Codes Compliance
Jamestown Condo (1165 83rd Ave N, bldg 33 unit C)  is using the property to store and sell vehicles. This resident's car business has been an obvious issue for over a year, and has been reported to the property management, the police and the city. The current property management and security are not taking care of the property issue, despite the condo association establishing rules regarding residents conducting any type of yard sales, home business or solicitation, trespassing, and parking violations. The authorities don't seem to know how to take care of the problem. Jamestown has really lost market value. It has been getting worse. Allowing a resident to park 3 or more random vehicles in any available visitor parking space, so that they can bring car shoppers on property every week is not improving the living conditions or property value in Jamestown. At the very least this is a violation of association rules. As a resident, I was not told that the building where I own a condo is also zoned for a auto sales business. Related to the issue, this condo community has had numerous problems with cars being stolen, and vandalism over the past 10 years. The city and the property should be working together to improve this residential community.	Codes Compliance

Also while walking the property I noticed quite a bit of electrical boxes with no covers or are falling off the building. Now we have a large hole in front of some buildings that's been an accident waiting to happen for over a month or more. I also noticed the maintenance men installing an a/c, I asked them and they said they didn't need to be a contractor when replacing items like this or a water heater, is this correct?

The last tow Saturdays Hobson Street N.E. between 55th Avenue NE and 58th Avenue NE floods terribly. It is so bad that it prevents the residents from leaving their homes or returning home. I have a sedan and was stranded last Saturday for 3-4 hours and could not get out for a meeting at 1 p.m. The previous Saturday, I had been out and c ould not get home. I realize we had a tremendous amount of rain, but the drainage should be better. The rain from the surrounding streets all collects at the end of the streets (55th & 58th). Cars get stuck in the water all the time. 10-15 years ago the city put some new drainage pipes in this neighborhood, but not on this street. It's time for something to be done Enough for being stranded!

This home is literally falling apart.  The facia and soffits are falling off of the house all the way around.  I'm sure mold and fungus are growing everywhere in the attic and the house because of exposer to the elements and rain.  The roof is starting to sag where the facia and soffits are missing.  It's becoming a hazard to those of us and our animals that have to live around it.  You can here animals in the back yard at night.  A screened porch has fallen down on the back of the house and only the door frame is left standing.  There is a bathtub full of water standing in the back yard.  There is an old hot tub left in the back yard that is visible in the back yard of the house next door because the fence is falling down all the way around.

The landlord for this property works for code enforcement in the city of Clearwater. His name is Mr Manit Sukhasam. We moved in 2 yrs ago, we gave his manager Mr Jimmy Walker $1800 to move in. All work that was supposed to be done never was. We repeatedly tried calling the landlord he never once spoke with us, matter of fact we never in 2 yrs ever laid eyes on the man. We only dealt with Mr Walker, who recently passed at the end of January. Upon moving in we paid for new carpet new stove new refrigerator. The old ones were filthy full of roaches and completely unsanitary. This home has so many issues, there's holes in floors, rodents and roaches and other critters come through. There's leaks under kitchen sink we must keep a bucket under it to catch water (where we find many dead rodents when we dump water)however the bottom of cabinet is soaking wet and rotting. The half bath that we believe is illegal because it states on city documents its a one bath not 2. The toilet leaks we must turn valve off or it keeps running and leaks water on floor.There's some wooden thing behind toilet that we tried stapling up because its a big long hole and roaches ghost ants and rodants come in. In the said bathroom the tiles are broken and cut our feet when were not careful, they come up off floor. Also the window in there is broken. The third bedroom we don't use because there's water leakage on walls and one of the windows leak water so we only keep news paper on it. The vent on floor in hallway sticks up we have to pound it down our children have cut themselves many times as we have also. There's a hole in the duct in there we had rats coming in but husband fixed what he could. There's water damage in living room ceiling, bathroom and above washer dryer. You can see paint is damp and sags and some fell on my husband while on couch. The window in living room is broken it literally comes out as well as top window comes down, some windows don't even lock. There's a big hole by washer and dryer we try to cover with something so nothing comes through. The bathroom with shower has a huge hole where vent is roaches rodents lizards anything that fits come through. The shower tiles are falling off the wall behind tiles has literally rotted away due to leaks you can see the wall studs n pipes. That was the only picture I was able to send I have more. There's no fire alarms in home. None of the doors fit properly, there's huge cracks letting air in and out. The front door is so hard to open and shut. We have been living in hell, I'm disabled and my husband has recently become unable to work due to injuries. Its been so difficult to try and move. Please help. We did call code enforcement 2 weeks ago. No response. Thank you for your time please send someone. Cynthia 727-906-2809	Other

To: Verified Officials, Mayor’s Action Center 4, and Stormwater 3:

Via the apparent acts of dissimulation and prevarication, you have archived multiple complaints and forwarded them to an incorrectly closed issue regarding a public health problem in the City of St. Petersburg, on a City-managed retention pond with a City chosen and installed system that is running and is seemingly inappropriate and/or deficient.

The non-mandatory (voluntary) homeowner’s association of the neighborhood is not the appropriate point-of-contact for getting City questions answered about the City’s choice for remediation or its process thereof.

This photo is an example of the state of large toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) build-ups in Harbor Isle Lake, ongoing the past year and a half. This photo, courtesy of the DEP, is from the sampling on Wednesday February 19, 2020 at the block’s entrance. The results of the sample were posted on Friday, February 21st, that read:

Level of Microcystin toxin: 560 ppb

This value is 70x the max limit of 8 ppb, the new 2019 EPA guideline for contact with water that contains Microcystins.

This value is 4x the highest level measured last year of 138 ppb for Harbor Isle Lake.

https://fdep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=50c82b8b2a6f4d138f40187f616fe27d

 
The City has provided no answers or updates in written form to all residents. What is going on?

It is expected that this issue will be archived/ closed, as all the previous were.	Other

This is more of a question but might also be a request.  We have grass continually growing up between the street and the gutter, which eventually blocks the gutters with dirt and mud.

From what I can tell there is a business renting scooters out of this house, which is an approved home business but you aren’t actually supposed to run it from your house since this is a neighborhood and not a commercial district, at least that is how it reads.  Is this code meant to push scooter rentals in front of everybody else’s house since the only house you can’t park in front of according to code is your own?  Doesn’t seem like the intent of allowing this type of business, to have scooters parked exclusively in front of other peoples houses.  Does seem like a nice way for the public to pay for somebody else’s scooter storage provided you comply with the loosely enforced parking code though.	Codes Compliance

Picture says it all. The street is rapidly disappearing due to grass growing in it. This is near the intersection of 7th St., South and 13th Ave., South. 

This should NOT be the responsibility of the adjacent property owners! The city already makes us maintain the right of way and the health and maintenance of the trees that the city planted in the right of way and maintain the curb along the street in front of our houses… Now the Code Officer is telling me that we’re supposed to be responsible for half of the public street as well??!! This is getting ridiculous, the city virtually has no responsibility for any of the property they own: the streets, the right of ways , the sidewalks, the alleyways… It’s totally ridiculous.

ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS within the last 2-3 months I have been northbound on 8th Street with a green light showing for northbound traffic at the intersection with 5th Avenue and a car traveling westbound on 5th Street has blown through the intersection as I was approaching apparently running what I assume to the “offending car” is a red light.  Because I’ve seen the same thing happen three times, and the car running the red light was going at full traffic speed I think there may be a problem with the synchronization of the traffic light.   Had I witnessed this same event only once I would not be contacting you BUT this last Tuesday I witnessed it again.  Please check the functioning of the traffic lights for this intersection.  This could lead to a horrible accident with the potential for loss of someone’s life.	Traffic Issue

	PTO - Trouble Report
If you are heading east on 5th Ave North you come to the intersection where you can only go right or left.  the problem is that the light is a solid green to go left.  The oncoming traffic also has a solid green which the person turning left is unaware of unless you almost got hit before trying to make the left.  I believe that a blinking yellow should be used for the left hand turn to notify people to be cautious or place a sign there that says oncoming traffic has right of way.  There should not be a solid green which indicates it is okay to turn when it may not be the case.	Traffic Signal Issue

The alley behind the address is just terrible.

 I am asthmatic and it is a huge health concern for me and my family.
I am requesting that the alley gets paved to stop this problem and for the safety. I have spoken with many other residents who use the alley and they are all feeling the same way. One of my neighbors is an elderly gentleman who uses an oxygen tank to breathe and it is especially difficult for him.

We are a 55 and up mobile home community Americana Cove.  This address 223 Mt. Piney Avenue NE and several other homes on Mt. Piney Avenue NE located here in the community, run along the fence line dividing us and 74th Avenue NE.  These homes have extreme flooding due to no drainage for water.  It is reported that there was or is a drain on the other side of the fence but it has been eliminated.  The resident at on 74th Avenue NE reported that the city took away the drain and the city claims the resident did.  This is a very dangerous health issue with all the standing water from heavy rains, mosquitos,  etc... and we need the city to help with this serious problem.  Americana Cove is located at 7201 1st Street NE.  The fence divides our community and the homes along 74th Avenue NE.

On Friday, 5/8/2015, I visited the Rio Vista Park to enjoy the nice weather, and to my surprise, I saw hookas at the park. A large family had gathered to have dinner at a shelter by the playground at Rio Vista Park. In addition to food, drinks, etc, they had brought hookas (2 hookas on 5/8/2015). Also, on the other side of the playground  Jehova witnesses had set up camp. Do any of these activities have to be permitted? Thank you.	Other

Freeport Avenue Northeast is flooded because the storm drains on the south side of the street are clogged. Water will not drain from the street and the street is essentially half-flooded and with it being rainy season, we can expect that the street will remain flooded. And, the street flooding is NOT tied to the tides in the canal. This is clearly due to the storm drains being clogged because the drains on the north side of the street are clear and are draining. Our street is sloped in the middle, so water cannot flow across the street but is stuck on the south half of the street.

This happens every year. The crews come out every year, early in the year, to clear out the drains however, they should be coming out closer in time to storm/hurricane season. Reason --- the drains do not remain clutter free for 6-8 months at a time due to lawn cuttings, tree debris, garbage, etc. that eventually end up in the storm drains.	Flooding

ACKNOWLEDGED Mayor's Action Center 4 (Verified Official)
Update from Engineering: Thank you for your post. As you know, Duke Energy is currently in the process of converting all their street lights to higher efficiency LED technology. The conversion project started in June 2018 and is on track to be completed sometime in the summer of 2020.

Some of Duke’s original incandescent streetlights had custom shields before they were converted to LED, and we are working with Duke to identify those lights so that the new LED versions can again be shielded.

Additionally, some of Duke’s newly converted LED lights need to be focused or redirected from spreading onto neighboring properties, and again we are working with Duke to identify those lights so that modified equipment can be ordered, manufactured, and installed. This process takes time, at least 4 to 6 weeks in some cases. We have made note of your location and your request and will include it with the others that we are relaying to Duke.

If you haven't already, please comment back with the pole number or any other identifying description that can help Duke more easily locate the light being reported.

We appreciate your help and your patience as we work with Duke Energy to improve the lighting throughout our city. Thank you again for your post.

Your request for review of the newly installed LED street light has been forwarded to me for response. It is very helpful if you could provide me with the Pole number (silver plate, usually start with a letter and is 5-6 digits) and/or exact location (across street from your property, alley, etc).

A field check will be conducted on the site and I will update you regarding the status. As stated in the SeeClickFix response to you, if a shield is warranted, it may take 4-6 weeks for installation as they are fabricated for each site.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Follow up to issue reported yesterday. City contractor BLD provided a video and stated that the clog was not on City property. Leland Plumbing was contacted and the technician confirmed the clog and used a 50' auger which he reported clears most clogs. It was not successful so technician added 50' also without success. Our house is about 60' front to back. Finally he added another 50' for a total of 150' which he stated is unusual and extends beyond our property to the street.  The clog was then removed. We believe that the BLD video was inconclusive and that the contractor is responsible for the $298 service.	Water Systems Issues

	Tree Trimming
It has come to my attention that your Park Rec Department is in charge of  tree trimming along our city streets. My neighbors and I are deeply concerned about the lack of attention my neighborhood is getting 

even when you and the department heads have toured the neighborhood and seen the overgrowth for yourself.

I live at 151 Starr St and have 2 giant older trees that are enchroaching the other side of the street. They have been dropping smaller branches on vehicles and the roadway  and sidewalks  for quite some time. I 

also want to bring this to your attention, the branches have entwined themselves around electrical wires and if those branches keep swaying in the wind , hit buy a truck or just come down , I am afraid it will take 

the electrical service down with it or hit someone walking down the sidewalk . These trees are quite old and the root system is starting to lift the sidewalk and encompass the house where i live . I hate to think what 

they are doing for the underground gas,sewer and water mains. That could be another reason to remove them.

I am a senior citizen on a fixed income and can not afford the expense of such a thing.  When big trucks come down the street the tops of them drag on the branches.This is a accident waiting to happen and 

would be a terrible situation and would like some help from your department	Tree Trimming

Does the city still use the PortageAlert system? 
Two years ago the city campaigned for citizens to sign up for this mass communication tool. The last time it was used was December 2016. 
I'm surprised the city did not use PortageAlert during this weekend's unprecedented rain and flooding. 
In my opinion the city could have used this system to effectively inform citizens about closed streets, asking citizens to avoid certain streets, supporting public safety with traffic control etc. 
I have a feeling the city bought this tool but does not use it as intended (= waste of money). Can you evaluate the use of this tool and make sure it gets used to it's fullest potential again? And inform us here about your findings?	Other

At 2:30 AM, this morning, the ongoing situation at the Lark Tavern became unbearable again and the police had to be called. Why is Lark Tavern, and to a lesser extent, the Lionheart, allowed by the BID and by APD to violate city ordinances? The noise ordinance is 24 hours per day (in terms of genuinely unreasonable disruptive noise) and 11:00 PM is patio closing time. Lark Tavern keeps their patio open with people being served alcohol until the police have to shut them down which was after 2:30am this morning. Many times, it's up to 4:00 AM with APD driving by ignoring the large crowds and  resulting excessive noise. Neighbors on Willett, Lark, Madison and Dana have attempted to call the Lark Tavern to tell them to get control of their patrons and shut down their patio, but they don't pick up their phone so it escalates to the police. On top of the patio violations, cars are driving through the park and  past Lark Tavern until 4:00 AM  with pounding bass, honking at their friends who are outside of the Tavern and yelling back and forth to each other. This constant noise gives an impression that anything goes so the patrons leaving the Lionheart also start yelling across and down the street. 

Allowing patrons to take their drinks outside to smoke and congregate on the patios and sidewalks is also not acceptable for getting around the patio limits yet both the Lark and the Lionheart allow this.

On top of all this, just walking down Madison, past Lark Tavern at night, is like running a gauntlet of trash talk and what women go through at times is disgusting. People are also finding it increasingly difficult to enjoy the patio at Shogun or the outdoor tables Ben and Jerry's. 

Where is APD? Where are the routine foot and car patrols which should be noticing and addressing this level of noise, at these hours, and shutting down bar outdoor areas AT 11:00 P.M. whether they are reported as an issue or not? A dangerous and disruptive free-for-all is being allowed and is increasingly violent both verbally and physically. There were already shots fired, in this very densely populated area, as a result of an altercation at Lark Tavern a month ago. What is it going to take for APD to proactively police establishments and hold the owners, managers and patrons accountable?

And please spare us the usual response that this has been assigned to APD and people should contact their neighborhood engagement officers. This has been done ad nauseam with no  improvement.	Noise Complaints

Submitted on 8/19/2016:  "I checked the tree yesterday and NOTHING on the UPPER PART of the tree has been trimmed at all. Why was I told it was completed? When will someone be going back to the house and trimming the upper limbs off my house? It is rubbing on the paint on the building and hanging over the roof & in the gutter. This is causing damage to my house continually everyday and will cause more damage once the ice builds up on the limbs in the winter & the leaves fill the downspout of the gutter. Please advise when I can expect these limbs to be trimmed away from & off my house. Thank you,

Every night, Lark Tavern leaves their doors open and disturbs the neighborhood with its loud music and groups of people who stand in the doorway and spill out onto the sidewalk through closing time. Patios have an earlier closing time for a reason. Why are these violations not addressed by APD patrol officers, and the owner informed that the doors need to be closed at least no later than when the patio closes? And, yes, APD has been notified.

The accompanying photo is what it looked like at Lark Tavern at nearly 2:00 this morning, almost 3 hours after outdoor areas are required to shut down. Tables were still set up outside. The Lionheart didn't look much better and that establishment was using power tools out on the sidewalk past 11:00 pm during recent construction work that could easily be heard on Dana. 

The two significant issues which continue to go unaddressed by the business owners/managers, APD and the BID are the noise/crowd control (including an increasing level of verbal harassment, safety issues, and physical violence) and the necessity for foot patrol to 5:00 am on the blocks of Lark and Madison with establishments staying open past 11:00 pm. 

Vehicle patrol is ineffective. Officers drive by with windows rolled up. They regularly drive past altercations, harassment, aggressive panhandling, intoxicated people laying or passed out on the sidewalk, and loud drunk crowds in front of establishments well after the outdoor cut-off time of 11:00 pm. It's past time for APD to have officers on foot nightly so they can hear what is going on and can see past all the parked cars to what is happening on the sidewalks.  It may also be time for the BID to have more homeowners and from higher-issue blocks and reconsider having presidents from late-night establishments that serve alcohol. Even if well-intentioned, it can be too much of a conflict of interest and the fox watching the hen house.  

Businesses, residents, the BID and APD officers are hopefully versed on Albany's noise ordinance which can be found here with a few excerpts below:
https://www.noisefree.org/cityord/albany.pdf

And for anyone with the tired one-sided argument that people should know what they are getting when they move here: People who move here, and especially those who purchase and invest in the neighborhood with their money, time, and effort, do so reasonably trusting the ordinances that are in place to make it a livable community for all, are being followed and enforced.  If businesses don't want to do that, they should open their establishments in a less residential area. And, if the city is going to allow 4:00 am establishments in such a dense residential location, the city is equally obligated to monitor and enforce the noise and safety issues that accompany their decision and impact quality of life so seriously. Residents need to stop getting the short end of this situation and businesses need to start grasping that their success is due in large part to the very residents they are disrespecting.  For the record, I'm no uptight prude.  My friends and I are regular patrons of Lark Tavern, the Lionheart, and other establishments, but that doesn't mean we think they are above the law or considerate behavior for a neighborhood that is also residential. Fun and socializing are great, but so are safety and the ability to enjoy our streets and homes with some modicum of safety and peace, and to be able to sleep at reasonable hours without needing a white noise machine that has to be on the volume of a jet engine. 

§ 255-24 General restrictions.

a reasonable person of normal sensitivities or to make, continue or cause to be made or continued, between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., whether in the operation of any

The following was received via Facebook:

I would like to know what the city is going to do about the trucking company hauling tallow to the mill on Sutherland spilling their load all the way through town. I'm not a resident of Brooks but do work there, this company has spilt tallow (hot liquefied fat for those that don't know) on several occasions from their unsecure/over filled trailers. Today as I'm riding to work I find that they have managed to completely coat the off ramp from hwy 1 to the truck stop as well as every single corner or intersection they crossed. This stuff stinks!!!!, it's not hard for anyone to tell what it is, it's also very slippery and dangerous for anyone who happens to be riding a motorcycle such as myself. I don't think I need to explain what happens when you try to come around a curve on liquid fat soaked asphalt, thankfully for me the stuff stinks and knowing what it was I could slow down in time to still safely make my turns. I don't need to name the company, everyone has seen the trucks hauling tankers coated in grease going through town, I would just like to know what the town plans to do about it before someone gets injured or just because it stinks and I can't think of another company that would be able to spill products all over the road on multiple occasions and get away with it.

They have in the past have either taken in or brought home animals and our neighborhood has reported them before for having dog(s) they would let out and roam. This time they have brought home 2 kittens and are now cats. They are always wandering around and while that would not be so bad they often park themselves on the door steps or in the open garages of the neighbors. Again wouldnt be so bad but they are difficult to chase out and sadly we have a severe allergy to cats in the house and simply cannot have them in the garage, on the porch due to this.  We are not the only ones around here with the allergy either.  Just would like someone to let them know that its not just a unlicensed pet outdoor issue- its a health issue especially when we cant seem to get them to leave the garage once they get in and it makes working out in the garage difficult with this happening.

SAFETY ISSUE  -  sidewalk slime after sinkhole repair

As a resident in an adjacent building of the complex, we were without water all day.  I am very thankful for all the first responders and the intense rapid coordination by several city departments and the utilities.  An amazing job was done in a day.  When water was restored to residents in ran BLACK and slimey for a while.  I have no idea why it was so slimey and sticks to every surface.  I am concerned about the slime left on the sidewalk as we approach rain storms and possibly the first SNOW int he coming week.  When wet or icy this sidewalk will become a sever slip & fall hazard.
This morning, Fri Nov 8, when walking I noticed black mud & slime on the sidewalk.  Weather report says possibly snow this Tuesday.  As snow partially melts then becomes ice, this slimey area will be super slippery, even more than if it were just leaves and dirt.
Maybe DPW can power wash it or some entity can further scrape the black mukh (slime) off of the sidewalk.	Sidewalks and Curb damage
In the northbound lane just before and under the overpass there is a section in extremely poor condition - drivers either swerve over the double yellow line to avoid that section, or else have to slow down to 10 mph. The first time I drove over it, I thought I had actually broken my truck.	Potholes

It has come to my attention that your Park Rec Department is in charge of  tree trimming along our city streets. My neighbors and I are deeply concerned about the lack of attention my neighborhood is getting 

even when you and the department heads have toured the neighborhood and seen the overgrowth for yourself.

I live at 151 Starr St and have 2 giant older trees that are enchroaching the other side of the street. They have been dropping smaller branches on vehicles and the roadway  and sidewalks  for quite some time. I 

also want to bring this to your attention, the branches have entwined themselves around electrical wires and if those branches keep swaying in the wind , hit buy a truck or just come down , I am afraid it will take 

the electrical service down with it or hit someone walking down the sidewalk . These trees are quite old and the root system is starting to lift the sidewalk and encompass the house where i live . I hate to think what 

they are doing for the underground gas,sewer and water mains. That could be another reason to remove them.

I am a senior citizen on a fixed income and can not afford the expense of such a thing.  When big trucks come down the street the tops of them drag on the branches.This is a accident waiting to happen and 

would be a terrible situation and would like some help from your department	Tree Trimming

The red light needs to be made longer, and the walk sign needs to be on longer.  At least 20 or 25 seconds would be more appropriate.	Traffic Signal / Pedestrian Signal

The traffic signal facing the Howe St. side of traffic at this intersection is currently mis-timing (normally works fine). I've seen multiple cycles of green for the MLK side while Howe never changes (yet the walk signal is cued in correctly). Hence, I have seen a LOT of cars burning through the red out of frustration while oncoming traffic on MLK is still moving through. It's quite dangerous.	Traffic Signal / Pedestrian Signal

the road surface area next to the post office, past  IKEA going towards Wooster Square, is like your grandma's washboard. the damaged surface is most likely due to runoff from the overhead 91/95/34 connections and heavy construction truck traffic.  it's been rough for at least a year.	Potholes

Drivers heading Southward on Church Street South (toward Union Ave.) are not aware that 
•	Traffic heading Northbound over Church St. Ext. bridge (over R.R. tracks) has a left-turn-only signal.
•	Therefore Southbound traffic turning right-on-red, onto Union Ave. (to head toward Spring St.) risks a collision with Northbound vehicles that simultaneously are exiting bridge during left-turn-only green signal to turn onto Union Ave. (heading toward Spring St.)
•	THEREFORE a “No Turn On Red” sign needs to be installed at the intersection of Church St. South & Union Ave.—for vehicles heading Southward on Church St. South. (Such a sign already exists for Northbound traffic exiting bridge to turn onto Union Ave. toward RR Station, because there is a left-turn-only signal for southbound traffic turning from Church St. South onto Union Ave. towards RR station.)	Signs
The light in the fixture never shuts off -- it burns 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  It has been on for several years. As you travel down Church Street South and approach the bridge at Union Avenue, it is the fixture on the bridge to the right-hand side of the intersection.  All other light fixtures on the bridge over the railroad tracks go off during daylight hours, but this one never shuts off -- it burns around the clock.	Street Lamp

This morning at approximately 830 am a police officer took a left from Church St South onto Union Ave.  The long line of tow trucks followed him through the light - about 6 of them went through the red light and blocked the intersection (Do the tow trucks have the right to go through red lights?) Then right in front of the driveway to the train station the police officer stopped dead and did a u-turn along with all of the tow trucks (at this point, the light on Union Ave was green so they were doing their u-turns right in front of oncoming traffic.  I don't think they have the right to break traffic laws, do they?	Street Sweeping

Green light going eastbound on Bassett crossing Dixwell Ave is too short. Because it is a single lane, cars waiting to turning left cause a back up on Bassett. Sometimes only one car turns left.

Hello. The issue is twofold: first of all we live on the north side of the street and when the plows come and pile up all the snow it ices over and doesn’t melt as well as it does on the southside. However because of the way that the road is constructed and graded all snow piles and melts right in front of our house and our neighbors as well. This results in an overflow of water under the sidewalk which then re-freezes and becomes a hazard. Right now it is very very dangerous and there is nothing that we can do to stay on top of it. This is because of the way that the road is constructed everything flows and melts and overflows and floods up on to the sidewalk it also doesn’t allow for clean drainage once snow melts off. We are asking for 1) the town to pay extra attention during snow removal so we don’t have the hazard of  ice flooded sidewalks and 2) to fix the grading of the road so this doesn’t happen going forward. Thank you	Street or Sidewalk Damage

I’m not sure what it takes to get something done. I know this isn’t a big item on your plate but I first corresponded with you in July. It’s now October. The problem is worse now than it was in July. Cyclists are now swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt from the driveway. It’s in the Midnight Pass/Higel curve. Eventually someone will get hurt. Cars routinely cut that corner with their right side tires in the bike lane – I know all too well as I was knocked off my bike by one right in that corner as I was riding in the bike lane. 
 
Combine cars with their tires in the bike lane with cyclists swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt and you have a big accident waiting to happen.

Many surrounding neighbors have been complaining for a long time and now something needs to be done.

It often occurs before 8am and after 10pm, and during the weekends it is very obnoxious as well. Please give them some kind of warning now, with the intent that it could lead to a fine if it continues. The owners don't even attempt to stop it, and often encourage it if they see they are barking at other animals.	Other

My concern is regarding two dumpsters that service the office buildings located on Van Dyke. One of the buildings address is 38850 Van Dyke. The problem is that on most weekends there is illegal dumping into these dumpsters by lawn care companies, construction companies or just people who dump bags of trash. The dumpsters are not located directly behind  the buildings, but at the back of the parking lots  against the brick wall that also borders my backyard. The dumpsters are often overflowing by the end of the weekend with foul smelling garbage that I can smell in my backyard. We have approached some persons while they were dumping,  and they have told us that they have permission to dump from the property owner.  My concerns are1) Why are  the  dumpsters  such a distance from the actual businesses,, unlike the dumpsters for the remaining business along vandyke where the dumpsters are much closer. 2) If the property owner wants to gives permission to other people to dump, does this permission extend to ingredients that would normally not be in a business dumpster like yard waste and construction waste( dry wall paste, old fixtures). This problem has been going on for a long time, but is getting progressively worse. I would be satisfied if the location of the dumpsters were moved closer to the buildings which I believe would discourage illegal dumping or if the property owner wishes to give permission to people, the overflowing dumpster would be located next to the business and not next to my yard. Any assistance in improving this situation would be very much appreciated	General Inquiry
I am writing to ask for assistance in identifying who is responsible for the upkeep and trimming of the retention drain located behind the office buildings on VanDyle betweein 16 1/2 mile and 17 mile East of Van Dyke that borders the backyards of the homes on New Bradord and Warwickshire. This retention basin has not been maintained for the past several years. There are branches growing through the fence, making the gate fencing unable to close. The fence itself is in poor repair and leaning, almost falling in several spaces. There is garbage all along the fence line. About 1-2 x per spring through fall season the  lawn is mowed but the tree branches are not trimmed. This property borders my yard. Every season I have done my best to trim what is closest to my yard, sweep, pull weeds etc. This barely makes a dent in the upkeep and by the end of the season, I am very frustrated.  Can you please help me by referring my complaint to the appropriate department. There are several business locations that also are in front of this area; Penna, Ikes and 3 office buildings. I would apprreciate knowing that this problem is being looked into and maintained for this upcoming spring and summer season.

My concern is the dumpsters from the office buildings next to my house. The office buildings are on Van dyke and their dumpsters are way at the back of their parkling lots, near the brick wall seperating them from my yard. These dumpsters routinely have illegal dumping from  grass clippings, extra bags of garbage. These dumpster are frequently overflowing and smelling. I often have to go and close the lids to control the smell that comes in to my yard. GFL is the number on the dumpster, but I cannot get through to find out the schedule for emptying the dumpsters. I am not clear as to why these dumpsters are so far away from the office buildings. Because they are located such a distance, People in the area routinely swing by and dump their garbage, some bagged, but often not bagged. I would appreciate someone following up on this situation. I filed a complaint last winter, but this is my first time bringing this to your attention. It is not a new problem, however but a longstanding concern.
Thank you,

Regarding the new pavement on New Bradford.  I want to say how happy we are with our new street, however there is an issue that I think needs to be looked at. The final step in the construction was applying tar in all of the concrete joints. On the East bound lane, starting at Van Dyke, none of the joints were filled for approximately the first 300 feet.  This was probably an accidental oversight by the crew at the time they did the rest of the street, but should be corrected before the winter freeze-thaw cycle begins, to prevent premature deterioration of the pavement. Could someone from Engineering please take a look at this situation?  Thank You

On Tuesday evening January 16, at around 7:30 pm my father called 911 regarding two men knocking on his door. I do not remember the officer who responded’s name.  He had encouraged my husband and I to stay at the house however, my father remained extremely agitated and my mother thought it was best if we left. So, I wanted to let the officer know that we left the residence on Friday to return to Vermont. I am concerned for my mother’s well being and wanted to be sure he knew we have left and that the social worker he mentioned does go there to check on them.

I believe that it would be very beneficial for the residents and drivers around this area if there could be some type of traffic control for events at Christ the King Church especially for Sunday service. In addition to people parking up and down 25th street, they are very inconsiderate and not mindful of other drivers when it comes to them going into and leaving the churches parking lot. I can't even begin to count how many times I've almost been hit or seen other people almost get hit by people pulling out of the parking lot. It's like they feel that they have the right away when leaving and will cut any and everyone off just rushing to turn in front of them and people are tired of it. Traffic Control should definitely be considered or the problem will just continue to get worse.	Police General Issue

There are a lot waiting for bus 31, late at night. Some of us from work, some of us from school and we need to be home immediately.

Please have more buses available for Route 31.	HART Comments and Suggestions
Bus Route 60LX at location 7827 at 4:54pm bus was late once again.  Every time this certain bus driver drives bus route 60LX in the afternoon the 4:30pm route that leaves Brandon Mall.  His operator number does not show up on the bus so I can not give you his proper operator number.  He was the bus driver for route 60LX the 4:30pm that picks up at Brandon Mall then goes downtown.  His certain bus driver every time he drives the route drives slow as hell, he acts like he is scare to drive the bus, when people get on the bus at the stops he stays put at the stop for at least 5 minutes after people get on no one else is getting on.  He is just slow as hell and people are try to get where they are going to.  Can someone please talk to his slow driver that drives the 60LX at 4:30 pick up at Brandon Mall. He works on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.  He might need to be retrained on how to drive a bus.  

Seems like every time this certain bus driver drives the 60LX starts at 4:30pm pick up at Brandon Mall he is always late as hell.  This driver is a black guy. 

Hopefully management can take care of this issue that always happens when this certain driver drives the 60LX on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays starting at 4:30pm Brandon Mall route.

You have probably received quite a few reports about this issue. But, I thought I should also issue a report (because this could become a very serious issue).

I've noticed that NW 43rd St has several bumps (between NW 39th Ave and Newberry Road). I'm not really sure why they poured cement over all of those manholes. I actually just moved back to Gainesville recently. So, I'm not sure when they performed this maintenance on NW 43rd St. 

But, I thought I should probably say something. The reason I thought I should say something is that I noticed that drivers are beginning to drive in the bicycle lanes (to avoid the "bumpy manholes"). So, this could create a problem for bicyclists. Sometimes the visibility isn't too great at nighttime. So, drivers may find it difficult to see bicyclists riding in those bicycle lanes. I thought I should say something here, because I don't want to see any of those bicyclists get injured. Thank you.	Road Repair

A new homeless encampment popped up yesterday Saturday by the garage entrance on Hickory Street at Van Ness where all of the Van Ness corridor infrastructure construction is underway.

Saturday daytime the City was laying fiber optics in this Hickory Alley, and then later in the evening this homeless encampment popped up, blocking the sidewalk. 

There's large pieces of furniture which have also materialized on the sidewalk. The encampment had taken the City construction signs, and furniture, along with blankets to set up the tent on the north side of Hickory.

One person is currently sleeping there making noises.	Encampment
I counted 121 skip scooters in Hickory alley at approximately 50 Hickory Street. They are present every morning and now that it's Sunday they seem to have been accumulating for two days in a row, overnight. I speculate that the scooters are picked up from around the neighborhood and dropped off right here because the skip scooter Warehouse is one of these garage doors on Hickory. the scooters have been pushed to one side, which is good, but there are a hundred and twenty one of them and many of them are no longer able to fit. I measure a minimum Gap for walking along the sidewalk of two feet, except for one place where a scooter has fallen over and is completely blocking the sidewalk. For the most part the scooters allow two and a half feet of space on the sidewalk for people to walk.	Blocked Pedestrian Walkway
Please add more dramatic traffic control to the Hickory Alley at Van Ness intersection, where Construction has disrupted the normal safety of the intersection.

Currently Van Ness at Hickory Alley, near Fell St, is under construction for a new sewer. The exit to Van Ness from Hickory is being sped through by drivers, now that they see the Van Ness traffic further out than the standard, I assume. The Sidewalk previously was where cars had to merge with Van Ness, but now the merge with traffic is well into Van Ness Avenue. And the Hickory Alley drivers are abusing that. They are blowing through the sidewalk. They ignore the pedestrian crosswalk more frequently than before the Construction.

I just saw a driver go through at 20mph. They're stopping only out at the temporary Muni platform, two lanes deep into Van Ness. I've lived here for years and it's much worse, coincident to the Construction.

Please consider adding more dramatic signs to dampen the danger of this poorly prepared Construction Zone.	Parking & Traffic Sign Repair

This intersection needs a serious update as the traffic here is always terrible.

Division Street behind The Roxy Supper Club, this area attracts many visitors that are unfamiliar with the area.  Not only are there many problems with entering the parking lot for The Roxy and the adjacent parking lot, but there are frequent on street parking rules broken.  I think part of the problem is that the parking lot next to the Roxy's property doesn't have/use a dedicated drive entrance.  Cars speed down Division and then take a quick soft left diagonally to reach the other lot.  Also, why does that parking lot have the ugliest fence ever? It looks like someone bought it from the set of the Batman and Robin movie. Not the best image for new visitors in our downtown. Is there not an ordinance for poorly maintained barbed wire fencing that doesn't even keep anyone out because its not fully enclosed? 
Cars often block part of the driveway entrance for the apartments across the street, I know it is painted yellow on the curb, but it is never enforced.  Visibility is lacking when cars are parked in the yellow zone.  Thank You for your help.	Traffic or Street Sign Issue

We live next to the channel. I know fishermen have a right to access the channel BUT do they have the right to tear it up and leave us, my next door neighbor to clean up after them? Seems like they have more rights than us! This winter we had ice fishermen come with heavy wagon like shanty

and drag them down the rocks and loosen them up plus ruin some of the grass. One Saturday before Christmas there were 14 trucks parked by our house and they all had those shanty’s and pulled them down the rocks and then back up. I took video to prove my point and pics! I have been down to city hall numerous times. My neighbor and I mow, rake , and shovel in this small area between us and have planted grass. Ok, I know they have to have access BUT since when are they allowed to drag those shantys on the rocks and grass. Since this is a dead end residential area, could u please forbid them from using the shantys on the rocks? If they want  they can access the same area from the end of Murdock or the park is less than 2 blocks! We pay a lot of taxes on this street and shouldn’t have to deal with having the easement destroyed because it didn’t happen til this winter as far as portable shantys Please outlaw them in this type of environment.

During the winter, this stretch of pavement ices over completely making it unsafe for pedestrian traffic. In the spring, this section floods, and both sides of the sidewalk are waterlogged so you can’t get around it. So you either get wet or muddy.	Parks
This is part of the path that’s behind Traeger school. In the spring, this section floods and there is no way to get around it. Both sides are very muddy and the puddles in the middle are fairly deep. In the winter, this section is a solid sheet of ice. Very dangerous.	Parks

The tenants living at 1304 Otter Ave have a boat parked on the grass on the East side of the property. This property has no driveway. They parked it there using my driveway (1306 Otter Ave). I foresee problems with this when the weather gets nice and they are on my property to move the boat in and out.	Parking in Grass
Several neighbors on Otter Ave. have voiced concerns over the condition of this rental property - 1216 Otter Ave. This has been an ONGOING problem.  We can only imagine what the inside looks like. We would strongly suggest that the whole front yard be mowed down! Don't worry about what little flowers are left there, they appear to be covered in weeds anyway. Just MOW IT ALL DOWN and make it easier on the renters. Someone please dig up the random trees growing there also. Also, if you do not keep up with cutting the lawn, you welcome more rabbits, mice and other rodents to take up residence in your yard; not to mention that your neighbors will see an increase in having rodents in THEIR yards. The back yard is completely neglected. The grass is going to seed and the landlord left a rusty, old mangled wire fence there. The only good it serves is to keep the rodents in the back yard.... maybe. It certainly isn't a safe environment for a family with FIVE children living there. 
If you do not have a lawn mower then we suggest you ask your landlord to take care of it or hire someone to do it for you on a regular basis. And if someone DOES happen to come to do weed control (spray) please warn your neighbors in advance because there are small children and pets living in close quarters and we don't want our kids coming in contact with that poison - nor do we want the poison killing our flowers/landscape. 

The condition of this home looks awful compared to the rest of the street - and the majority of the Stevens Park Neighborhood. Please do your part to take care of it.	Property Maintenance

Sidewalk in front of property has a major change in elevation between squares. It is causing tripping issues when people run in the neighborhood and are not aware of the issue.
 It was marked to be fixed along with the rest of the neighborhood sidewalks, but for some reason someone painted over the squares not to remove them. This is a public safety issue and needs to be fixed before someone trips and breaks a nose or an arm.	Pothole/Pavement/Curb
Trees in the alley behind 1031 Waugoo have grown up into the phone lines and they have been rubbing against the branches for several years. The phone lines are going to eventually come down. We called AT&T and they said they do not cut branches anymore.	Tree Pruning
Homeless man is living in truck, with trailer full of junk, behind 1017 Waugoo Ave. Junk is piled up against back fence of 1017 Waugoo Ave. It is a narrow, No Parking on either side alley. There is also a lot of scrap and junk in the side and front yard too. 
As far as I can see and hear the homeless man is friends with owner of 1017, but sleeps outside in his truck. He used to park out front until the neighbors complained, now he moved to the alley where he thinks he is out of site and can pile up his junk. This used to be a nice, quiet, clean neighborhood, now it is a 24/7 junkyard/shanty town!	Junk & Debris

Unsafe intersection when vehicles parked on right hand side (of cottonwood dr going towards schools) cannot see around them to safely cross! If you are turning left or right 
 off of prairie ridge avenue towards Boston pizza/new McDonald’s and vehicles parked along the side make it impossible to see. The stop sign is pretty far back and you can’t see it from there, if you move up to end of the road you still cannot see, and you need to enter the intersection to see around the vehicles. There is often a boat or a rv parked there too which makes it even more impossible. My fear is when McDonald’s is built along with school etc that’s going to be a very busy road and being able to see to exit prairie ridge will be absolutely critical! (I did take pictures late in the evening put it in park with 4 ways on as it’s been an issue I’ve seen for awhile now and was the only way to physically show what I meant)	Roads & Sidewalks
The sidewalk at the vacant property between Little Caesars and 7/11 has not been shovelled all winter. This is a chronic problem at this property every winter. I'd hope they'd face multiple fines by now.	Roads & Sidewalks
the sidewalks North and south of the one in front of 7-11 never get plowed/shovelled. it is so annoying walking along the road when there is snow, especially with a stroller. I'm not sure if it has ever been doesn't in the last two years. if the seller/developer won't do it, the two should continue around the corner (as they already do Cottonwood) and bill the owner.

This vacant commercial property south of 7/11 has knee high weeds. These property owners should follow the same bylaws as town residents and should be mowed every 2 weeks.	General Feedback/Other
The sidewalk at the McDonald's construction site on the SE corner of Parkwood and Cottonwood is blocked by the construction fence.  While our administration's response is that the sidewalk is closed and close the issue, this is unacceptable.  There is no construction on the public property and the fence should placed within the property lines.  This poses a significant safety risk to pedestrians, children, by forcing them to walk on the road.  If it is truly necessary to "close" the sidewalk, the contractor should build a temporary walkways as the do in the downtown of any city.  To simply declare the sidewalk closed is lazy on the part of the contractor and the Town.  Put residents safety first.	Roads & Sidewalks
Rather than move the construction fence 2' onto their property at the construction site on the SE corner of Parkwood and Cottonwood they moved it out 8' blocking the sidewalk on Cottonwood Dr.  this now forces pedestrians to walk on the road or jaywalk.  This causes pedestrians an even GREATER safety risk.  the construction fence should be confined to their property.	Roads & Sidewalks

Not surprisingly, due to the Town of Blackfalds blatant disregard for public safety and unwillingness to plow our roads, a large puddle has puddle has formed on the North side oo Cottonwood Dr. at the Prairie Ridge Crosswalk.  This puddle formed due to the inability of the melting snow to drain because of the Town of Blackfalds refusal to plow the snow, even on this Priority 1 road.  This puddle renders this crosswalk inaccessible for the disabled, children, young families and elderly who are out walking in these warmer conditions.  As the weather inevitably drops below zero again the hazard to Blackfalds residents will only increase. Many children use this crosswalk to get to and from school.  The Town of Blackfalds not properly maintaining our roads puts those children at risk.	Roads & Sidewalks

I have lived at the corner of Elena and Kristi for more than 9 years.  For most of that time, the Green Waste truck, which picks up  on Tuesday mornings, has waited until at least 7:55 a.m. to begin collections in our neighborhood.  Over the past several months, however, the start time has been experiencing a noticeable forward creep a few minutes at a time (the noise wakes me up).  This morning they started at 7:45.
Is Green Waste subject to an 8 a.m. start?  If so, would you gently remind them of it? If not, I will need to make alternate sleeping arrangements!  Thank you.	Other

Greetings City of Los Altos Hills!  I'm an independent inventor and high-tech founder.  I've attended Foothill College in Spring Semester of 2011.  I was forced to withdraw from all three core technology classes for lack of sufficient support!  Foothill College didn’t help me succeed!  I experienced a flood of problems simultaneously every day for four weeks!  I’ve learned my identity and student technology accounts were stolen while attending Foothill!  I was locked out of my fianancial aid student account because the password was changed and it took weeks to reset it.  I received no assistance for a laptop even though my PELL grant was approved immediately.  I never received my Oracle database student technology account!  Foothill College deposited $119.00 dollars, for the first time in my student account the very next day after I withdrew from the school.  Foothill College’s Financial Aid office began sending me emails asking for a PELL grant refund of over $800 dollars that I never received.  I learned a student loan was taken out in my name while attending Foothill College.   I've only one student loan!  When I applied for Foothill College my student loan showed as paid for 300 months on my credit report.  It went from good standing to default without my knowledge.  I’m trying to clear my financial aid record and U.S. department of education accounts to attend classes again.  None of these problems are caused by me.  I'm planning a law suit!  I'm still homeless trying to launch my technology company in Silicon Valley!  My identity and business account are continuously stolen, switched and taken over in Silicon Valley!  My Associates Degree in database systems was destroyed by Foothill College and they must pay damages.  My life should be advanced by leaps and bounds by now!  I’m seeking an education law attorney.  Thank You!  Have a great day!  deenalouisemillsapp@yahoo.com	Other

New Utility poles were installed a couple years ago as the existing poles are very old and have been compromised. The electric service was relocated, but all communications services still exist on the old poles. One of these poles that had previously fallen is now being held up by a rope strung to a dead tree. Can pressure be put on the utility companies to move their lines so these old poles can be safely removed? Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.	Street Issue

Hello,
We cannot thank you enough for mowing the hill and right of way at the entrance of Laurel Ct. It looks so much better. We are willing to spray weed killer and put down landscaping fabric if you are willing to donate more mulch to cover the hill- then it will never need to be mowed again, just the right of way will. If you are willing, you can pile the mulch in front of the gate of right away and we will take care of hte project.	Parks, Grounds, Cemeteries Maintenance Issue
Hello, Thank you very much for donating more mulch to the corner of Laurel Ct. I write to request that you might possibly mow the right of away again, as well as the bank along Kearsarge Way? Also, by the stop sign, things are growing again which can make turning difficult to see pedestrians. Thank you again for the mulch. If possible, could you also donate some landscaping tarp and weed killer? We will do the labor- after you mow, we will kill the weeds, lay down the tarp and mulch. If you have any shrubs or plants, we will put them down too. Other than right of way, nothing will need to be mowed again. Thank you very much.	Parks, Grounds, Cemeteries Maintenance Issue

There are so many little kids around, and it is unsafe for a school area/entrance.	Traffic & Safety Issue
The sidewalks (and road) that go up and down the bridge that leads to the New Franklin School have a TON of debris on them -- I assume mostly from the pavement becoming loose over the winter/snowplowing. It makes it very dangerous for the children and parents to walk to and from school without slipping on a piece of broken pavement, rocks, etc. The hill is very steep and the debris makes it much worse. Many children and their parents walk to school and back every day and I think this issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible before someone gets hurt.  Thank you!!!	Sidewalk Issue

Dear Public Works,
I am writing this letter to plead for help on a water drainage issue at my house on 4 Coolidge dr. Whenever a rain fall happens the drain grate on the corner of my property becomes overwhelmed and the water backs up into my yard and our neighbor’s yard. The backed up water makes its own lake! This seems to be getting worse and poses problem with water entering my basement. I have tried to fix this with sand bags but I think a more permanent solution is required.

What was the result of the phone calls the town made to help mitigate this awful diesel exhaust over here?
There’s been a train parked and running the engine for the better part of 16 hours now. I can’t open the windows in my house because of the exhaust. I imagine this also violates the city’s noise ordinance. 
Thanks	Odor Complaint (Sewer)
Opening again, since our other one was closed. This is for the trains running constantly in our residential neighborhood. It is a health and noise concern.	Odor Complaint (Sewer)
Train engines are constantly running while parked. This continues to persist and degrade the quality of life in this neighborhood and all around the north mill pond area. I feel that this neighborhood deserves a better response from the city. Especially considering we have borne the brunt of the Portsmouth’s growing pains in the last four years. We have dealt with the construction of a new parking garage for three years, significant road work that started in June and now polluted air from higher rail usage. 
Please at least have someone from the city call the rail company and ask them to turn off their engines so we can breathe easier. Thanks.	Odor Complaint (Sewer)
My wife and I walk into town almost everyday and pick up trash and bottles and cans along Maplewood Ave between the North Mill Pond and Portwalk. It's particularly bad around the railroad tracks and the Sheraton's parking lot. On the weekends it's more than the two of us can carry.
We've been putting the trash and recyclables in the Marriott's receptacles. If the City could install at least a trash receptacle near the tracks maybe people would be less inclined to throw their trash on the ground and we would have a place to dispose of the trash we pick up.	Trash/Litter
I know the Maplewood sewer line is surcharged during heavy rain events but I would like to know when it's capacity is scheduled to be increased.

The south bound Rt1 light will turn red, the North bound turning light will turn red, but the North bound light never loses the green signal and the cut through never gets a green light.	Traffic Signal
On Market at Submarine Way there are three traffic lights for two travel lanes. There is NO right turn lane. 
Cars zoom up the breakdown  lane and take a right on red. They pass vehicles with their right turn signal on and create hazardous situations where a vehicle in the right lane, taking a right turn gets surprised when they are turning and there is a car in the right of way for the legal vehicle.

This signal controls the flow of traffic into the city.  It is now going on randomly for upwards of a minute when no cars are there.  The walk light also goes on when no people are waiting to walk.

As a regular visitor to the City Recycling Facility I see a many vehicles without stickers. I have never seen an attendant challenge one of these vehicles. Given recent issues regarding disposing of recycled materials it is more important than ever the City is only accepting materials from City residents. Why does Public Works not enforce the sticker requirement. I suspect we are accepting and paying to dispose of material from outside the city. Additionally lawncare contractors regularly dump material at the City Yard. Signage outside the facility says "No Contractors". Attendants have no idea where this material comes from.

The signal for Islington turning onto middle rd next to Plains Field. It is very inconsistent in its timing. Often times takes over a minute to change even when there is no traffic and sometimes the traffic waiting to turn onto Islington gets the green first (showing up last) while there is traffic waiting to pull out of islington.  i clock this light often and has taken at most 2 min to change. i deal with this every single day waiting to turn left onto Middle. This issue began back when the road closed for the bridge construction. It was never an issue before the road closed and took an average of 10-15 sec. i have also whitnesed many motorists run the light. lastly it seems that this issue is worse when there is snow build up (closer to the 2 min with snow).

Recently the construction of the house at 917 Greenland Td was completed. Even more recently the owner put up a 6foot fence along Sherburne Rd. The intersection of Greenland Rd and Sherburne Rd has always been a little scary since it’s and odd intersection. With the addition of the fence it is now completely terrifying.  Cars coming up Sherburne from the neighborhood have always sort of stopped but now it’s as if the stop sign no longer exists. Coming from Borthwick towards Greenland Rd is equally as scary. I have no ide how to solve this issue other than maybe the fence being cut back or the stop sign moved?  I’ve spoke with other residents of the street, which are few since it’s a dead end but our neighbors have teenage boys, one who is learning to drive, and the other not very experienced. It’s just become a very dangerous intersection even though the traffic out and into Greenland Rd isn’t extensive.	Traffic & Safety Issue

The beavers have not been trapped out, the "water leveling pipe"  (AKA beaver deceiver) has been pushed up out of the water by the hard-working beavers, and the water is now 20+ inches above where it should be.

The water just keeps getting higher.  Help!
thanks, Dave    430-8018	Storm Drains
As far as we know, the beavers are gone (2 trapped, 2 dead on the road).  The attempted beaver deceiver is now more of a problem than a solution.  The water is over half way up the outlet pipe, nothing is flowing, and the mud+grate+pipe is keeping it that way.  Please remove the plastic pipe and get the water flowing again.  That will also pave the way for the next step from Mike of Atlantic Wildlife. 
 Thanks.	Storm Drains
It sure looks like we have beavers again :-(
I didn't even try to dig it out this time, since I know they are way more diligent and hard-working than I am.	Storm Drains
After 4 days (last Friday) the water was down 6" - good!   After 1 week (today, Monday) the beavers have completely walled in the newly caged 12" plastic pipe stub.	Storm Drains
While the trapper was seen a week ago, his results are unknown, the outlet is buried and there no sign of water flowing.  Water is higher than ever after Sunday's downpour.  There is a small flow out by the ball field, but that won't drain below the top of the 12" stub.	Storm Drains
The outlet is buried again, water is up.  To prevent this continuing issue, we probably need a trapper or a 'beaver deceiver'.	Storm Drains
Water levels are too high, and not going down.  The water level is above the new plastic outlet stub, and there's a little flow, but it looks as though a bunch of floating crap has probably clogged things up.	Storm Drains
Good Morning,
Any chance we could get the pond level down before everything freezes up for the winter?  The water level hasn't dropped in the days since the last downpour.  The riprap covered underdrain appears to be covered in silt up to the water level.  My yard is swampy. Nothing is flowing out under the new culvert across the HHCondo driveway, and the mud dam is gone.  I'll assume (hope?) the beavers are gone.

The water is up a foot over the invert, and the end of the 'beaver deceiver' is up out of the water, so nothing is flowing out.  I suspect it would be more effective to trap the beavers.  There are two lodges visible about 100' from the outlet, on the right.    thanks, Dave M.	Storm Drains

The beginning of Osprey Dr has four private homes and then Osprey Landing Units, Thr private homes have small children whom play with Osprey Landing children. The children cross the street at Osprey Drive to get to the park and other children. Twice a car almost hit a child because they were going so fast that they did not see the child. Can you please put speed bumps at the beginning of Osprey Dr and right before Osprey Landing Units are. If a child gets hit the consequences would be devastating.

Henry county Mcdonough; Stockbridge and Locust Grove litter is  deliberately being thrown all of Henry county.

Peter Kestic is intentionally leaving his trash receptacles in a manner which obstruct driving. If there is a 12" easement on an alley, how is he allowed to semi permanently store items. Normally people are not allowed to go out of their way to obstruct drivers from parking.
 Could I place bollards up or put large rocks 6" off the alley to obstruct drivers? There must be some way for the city to enforce obstructing an easement. If they were 12" off the alley there would be no issue but due to the size of the receptacles it is impossible to keep them off the alley because of the fence.
 He also did not get a permit to do the work in the alley which is permanent which should be enforced or removed.	Other

I just started working off Willow Road at a startup near Facebook and have noticed that like many large tech companies FB tries to foster a bike-friendly culture; however, Willow Road is not bike friendly.  It's more like Pet Semetary Road where speeding sand trucks and cars are hurrying to make it to the bridge or 101.  The stated speed limit is 40 but as with most of California driving, that limit is regarded as the minimum speed rather than the max.  This is an area that wants to be both a major artery and a tech-friendly hub.  It cannot be both without some traffic calming and enforcement.	Traffic Enforcement

My husband and I live next door at 5618 NW 34th Street. The house next door (5716) hosts feral cats that mark on our house, families of raccoons, opossums and armadillos. there is running water or gas from a pump. Multiple times we have heard teenagers break in. We have more mosquitos and bugs than other areas due to the abandoned house. Their "yard" is turning into woods, it looks like it hasn't been cared for for about 10 years. We moved in last year and have had to cut back the weeds and branches that encroach into our yard multiple times. No one has checked the mail since we have lived there. We found out who has paid the property taxes for the last few years, a gainesville resident, and offered to buy the land from them. We have not heard back. Ultimately we would love to buy the land and fix it up. Everyone on the street would like for the eye sore to be cleaned up.	Building (Abandoned/Damaged)

My suggestion is plant several rows of trees along Clark Butler Blvd between Archer Rd and SW 24th Ave in the center median. The center median can easily accommodate 3 to 4 rows of tree running perpendicular to Clark Butler Blvd. I would like recommended flowering trees that will add to the aesthetics to the new development. The Yellow Tabebuia is a very hardy tree with bright yellow flowers blooming in fall and spring and is very drought resistant. The Queen's Crape Myrtle is another very hardy tree with very low maintenance and is drought resistant. Thank you for your consideration.	Tree Planting Suggestion

Hi,

This intersection has been a huge concern of mine just waiting for an account to happen. There is no light there and cars fly by ignoring the pedestrian right of way. Today I almost got hit and it’s right across the street from a daycare so I fear children will be at risk as well. There needs to be a pedestrian sign or a light or some kind of police monitoring. This is especially relevant during rush hour times. Please look into this.	Fire & Police

Driving from Summer up Otto St. to make a turn on Plain St. is a very bad idea. When coming up Otto to make a left or right on Plain, there are a bunch of bushes to the left that obstruct the view of traffic coming up the bridge. When you go to pull out, often times it is way to late if there is a car coming. If they are coming fast, you don't stand a chance. Please redesign the flow of traffic on Otto St. or make the homeowner with all the bushes trim them back!! I think it would make sense if Otto was a one way going towards Summer St. The beginning of Summer and Plain St. is a one way. You should reverse the one way so that cars can clearly see what is coming off the bridge. This needs to be addressed ASAP! I see so many close calls everyday!	Other

Every morning, I have to a risk having an accident trying to yield left, without the assistance of the traffic light, like the opposite side. There are 3 lanes EXACTLY like the opposite side, yet only one direction is assisted with legally turning left. This is unacceptable.

Safety hazard: The section of Hamilton between Queens Chapel and the West Hyattsville Metro Station is dangerous. Pedestrians, cyclists and drivers are all at risk.

Can a crosswalk (preferably with flashing lights) be added to Ager/Jamestown street, leading into the metro?

Hello,

I drive on Pacific avenue a few times a week, and noticed there is a severe lack of Stop Signs. please add more "all way stops" at intersections. Most of them are one way, and when there is; there is often visual blockage such as trees or large trucks. Please add more stop signs. 

You would think a city with a 25mph speed limit, and prides itself on safety would actually have more stop signs. But I guess that like the dumb speed limit, the city planning is dumb too.

One of the neighbors that lives on Beach Rd has 8 cars.  Three of which are stored on the street and DO NOT MOVE unless they are reported.  This has been going on for nearly two years.  They have three that are stationary and the others they rotate between the street and their driveway.  The owners address is 223 Beach Rd.  

They are constantly reported and marked because it’s a huge inconvenience to other residents.  Then they drive the cars around a bit and then store again on the street for weeks at a time until someone reports them again.  This is a ROUTINE for them and a nuisance for all others on the block.

The three that have been stationary for weeks, if not months, are an older rust colored mustang across the street diagonal from their residence and two vintage cars in front of their residence.  These are classics and most collectors would put in storage.  One is pink and the other has a fire design. 

These three in combination with the others they rotate on the street make it difficult for other neighbors and guests to park. 

Their other cars include a Chrysler 300, Mercedes sedan, an old van, an el Camino and a Toyota SUV.  I understand that it’s a public street, however there is also courtesy as neighbors and laws regarding public storage of cars.	Parking Enforcement

RE: Shoreline Park on Bayfarm Island

Hi there,

Just came back from a walk along Shoreline Park. Behind a home in Promotory Point there are some guys moving rocks from the rip rap and it looks like they are making a rock pier out into the water. They have a blue wheel barrel and are also taking rocks from a stack/palette behind the house that has done their own landscaping into the park(all the way to the pathway).
As a boater I have a concern about them moving the rip rap and piling rocks into the narrow channel behind that home. High tide comes up and the boats wouldn’t see the rocks and their would be a big problem. Also isn’t this in violation of BCDC rules.

When I reported a street lamp at 3012 Thompson, at a certain point the app asked for an intersection. I wrote Thompson &cornell. The map asked me to pinpoint a location. It was near cornell university in New York. I tried to specify Alameda but I couldn’t get it to move to alameda, it stayed stuck in upstate New York. Finally gave up.

This signage doesn’t convey the fact that the traffic signal for Blanding will not operate unless a vehicle is at the stop bar (which has almost disappeared). Many times I have waited at the rear of a long line theu several light changes until the lead car finally crept up to activate the signal.	Roadway Markings and Traffic Striping
There are teenagers trespassing daily through a hole in the fence leading into the Encinal Terminal. They go in in groups and emerge through the same hole in the fence. This has been occurring daily. Calls have been made to APD however, they either show up after the teens have left or don’t show up at all. Please check this area out as there may be illegal activity occurring there with this high level of traffic.	Police Patrol Operations

Aloha,

I am a parent with a child in Makawao Boys and Girls club. I am having a difficult time finding someone to pick my son up from school since the club closed. Such closures cost the local economy in the long run in lost revenue. I ask you to fix the maintenance issue that has closed the building as fast as you can so I can continue to work regular hours. Please make this an urgent matter. 

Mahalo,

Maui County Code 10.48.030 limits parking in front of mailboxes by stating parking is prohibited "In front of an official United States Postal Service mailbox, where there is no sidewalk, from Monday through Saturday between the hours of seven-thirty a.m. and four-thirty p.m.; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to postal delivery vehicles."
Per MPD, this is unenforceable. In cases where mailboxes are on streets with sidewalks, they can be blocked at will and often are. This code needs to be updated to simply state mailboxes cannot be blocked and the code needs to be in compliance with the USPS regulation requiring a 15 foot approach/depart space for the mail delivery truck. At this time, many people have mailboxes blocked by people parking their vehicles in front of them. This is a common problem and it would be helpful if it were fixed.
Thank you	General Comments/Complaints/Other
