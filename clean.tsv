For 3+ weeks, a couch has set by the curb in the FRONT YARD. Trash pickup occurs in THE ALLEY. When driving down the alley, as is the case on a recurring basis (this has been reported/dealt with 2x in the past 2 years) the yard becomes a debris field, so saturated with trash & garbage & junk that it's hard to believe anyone actually lives there. It HAS to be a health hazard for the homes on either side or behind them. Bottom line; this home on our street ought to be held regularly accountable for allowing this nightmare to recur every few months. It ought not take their neighbors reporting them repeatedly to keep their property clean....or at least not a health hazard to the other residents in the area. Thanks for allowing the rant. Seriously.	Junk and debris

You closed the complaint before I could comment. To Jane, the problem is not the tightness of a structure, it's the direction the structure faces. Brick and other walls completely deflect sounds. When the drunken parties were going on at the reunion center, I was completely overwhelmed by the noise while neighbors 50 ft. away couldn't hear it. There was nothing but air between me and the noise and my neighbors had brick bldgs blocking the sound. It will be impossible for the city to make them heard by everyone. It's a primitive system I thought was abandoned years ago. Phone and email alerts are a possibility but then, there are the ones that have neither, but I've observed that even the town's poorest and most backward residents have a cell phone, so the technology is in place if it was just used.

A few months ago they where fixing some lines in the ally way and moved the trash cans to the front of the houses. They have been done in the alley way for sometime now and the trash cans are still in the front of the property. The issue is we have had slot of rain and this is a flood zone area so every time it rains the trash cans go floating down the road way bumping into vehicles. Also it is a pretty narrow street and they take up some much needed room.	Trash Container Issue

I work for CB&I 210 E 700 S Clearfield, Ut. 84015. My name is Kale St. John and I am one of the HSE Specialists here at this facility. We are having numerous complaints from our employees and other facilities in the surrounding area about this intersection. We would like to know what it would take to have a Traffic Arrow installed at this location for traffic traveling East to West. The wait time for someone to turn left during high traffic times is long. Especially during the morning commute. Traffic can back up by a numerous amount of vehicles. To install a left turn arrow at this location would be a lot safer all the way around for those turning and for oncoming traffic. I have seen numerous near misses at this location. Wanted to see if we could get anything done about this before there is a tragic accident.	Traffic Signals

Since moving to east Kaysville 4 years ago the flow of rush hour traffic in the evening has become much less efficient and bogged down, something is causing it to back up and slow consistently since changes were made on the north end of the stretch.  Hwy-89 moves at 20 mph excluding stop lights. This has added 15 minutes every day to what use to be a 20 minute drive. Please look into this, the problem has consistently gotten worse.	Other
I drive hwy 89 daily for over 15 years.  The islands you have on most of 89 need to go away.  They cause slick conditions in the winter and cause traffic congestions when someone is pulling into the very small turning lanes.  They cause more problems then good.  Just make a continuous turning lane like most of 89 already is.	Guardrail

The SB lanes are shifted a few feet left for HOV lane construction.  In the far left lane, there is a lot of uneven pavement and potholes just to the left of the yellow line.  Since the lanes are shifted over, cars are being forced to drive on these rough patches and over the potholes, or hug the middle lane divider to avoid them.  I'm concerned this is going to cause vehicle damage or an accident.  Please repair the pavement along this stretch of theedian since the lanes will be shifted for a while.	Pothole
On 2000 west and sr193, there are too many people not yielding. People making a left turn from 2000 west (southbound) onto 193 will take the turn while there is somebody making a right turn from 2000 west (northbound.) Who should this be addressed to?	Other

There are multiple lulls in the traffic heading the other way, and it is so long of a stop that cars are just going through the red light when there is an opening. I have seen this happen a few times now.	Traffic Signals
I got onto I-15 N/B in Lehi at 2100 N.  The new lane detour caused a large dust cloud with visibility dropping to around 100’!  I believe the road had not been cleaned or swept at all because I was taking rocks like machine gun fire!  I was just issued a new car, and now I have at least 5 hood dings, and a couple windshield chips!  That was a mess!	Road Debris/Rockfall
This area is a mess generally and I have many suggestions, but it would be great if there was signage to warn people on the south west side of the freeway that they're in a lane that will be forced onto I-15. They always awkwardly merge and cause the through traffic to have to wait through extra lights.	Signage
This intersection is majorly backed up when driving west to east on 85 before you go under the freeway.  The lights metering traffic coming off the freeway appear to stay green for several minutes, while the lights allowing traffic to go underneath the freeway are very short.  Traffic is horrendous!  I would also suggest some type of median that stops traffic from driving up the left lane and then cutting back to the right in the intersection.	Traffic Signals
Mitchdayley@gmail.com	Road Debris/Rockfall
Traffic is backing up at this intersection b/c the light for northbound & southbound travel is too short in duration. Only 2-3 cars can proceed per light cycle. Also, vehicles in the northbound left lane are attempting to merge into the right lane at the last minute b/c the left lane is only a left hand turn on to the I-15 N on ramp. This is adding to the northbound delays & traffic back ups for vehicles commuting northbound on 2100 N into Lehi. Another contributor is the on ramp for southbound I-15, just be before the signal light. Traffic backs up on SR-85.	Traffic Signals
Southbound on ramp to I15 at Thanksgiving pt. has absolute no signage that the lane is merging into traffic very quickly.  There is no white markings or arrows  on the pavement showing that they are merging or markers on the cement dividers.  Its dangerous and @#$%.

The evening traffic backs up clear through / north of the intersection with U-73. This is way to much and takes way to long to get through, something needs to be done. Even the back roads (800 West for one) have construction and some were closed Monday evening. Traffic blocks the intersection at highway 73, Pioneer Crossing and 400 North. Pioneer traffic that continues through Redwood west is backed up for miles. Sometimes the intersection is so blocked that no cars move through on several light cycles in a row.	Other

You can barely get one car through the light cycle especially if you are not quite at the lights when they turn green. They should be on for a set time not what appears to be one or two cars at the most. The best time is when the Junior high gets out but they only stay green longer because there is a long line of traffic. I get the impression they are working off the number of cars waiting in line to go. This is really annoying when you are a few tens of feet behind the line and the lights turn back to red. Also, if you get to the lights just as the lights on Canyon Road change to red, you will not get through the lights on this cycle. You have to wait for the next cycle. Please deal with this. It's really annoying. Can't you just have them on a set length?	Traffic Signals
You really need to put a physical lane restriction in at the eastbound junction of Canyon Road and 820 E, Spanish Fork. You have people using the parking lane on that corner as a turning lane to turn right onto 820 E southbound, when it is not. This causes the people in the main line of traffic (me frequently!!), who often are signaling to turn southbound on 820 E to be unaware of the person incorrectly sitting waiting to turn the same direction. I have seen several times where there has nearly been an accident because of this. This corner is a serious accident waiting to happen. Please, put in a physical island to stop these people using that lane to turn right. These lights are meant to help traffic flow, but they are just causing those of us who live round them to find them irritating and inconvenient.	Signage
The tree limbs appear to be blocking the sensor from sensing cars that are south bound on 800 east trying to either turn east onto Canyon Road or continue south onto 820 east. Or maybe the sensor isn't working.	Traffic Signals
Lights were out a couple days ago.  Seems the programming is messed up since. If approaching from south, light changes on NB side first then SB even if no vehicles are present on NB approach.  Did not seem to do this prior to the outage. Also, green is very long on the NB and SB approaches.  You may call me at 801-369-6169 for further detail. Thanks!	Traffic Signals
Every morning and afternoon there is a line to take kids to school at Spanish Fork Junior High, but because there is no turn signal at the traffic light on Canyon Rd to turn South on 820 E only two cars at most can go during these busy times. PLEASE put a turn signal there. I have to go around the block so I can go straight onto 820 E heading South instead of turning left. Otherwise, I have to wait through multiple lights to get through. Thanks for your consideration!	Traffic Signals

Why were there no warning signs that there would be a lane closure on Bangerter going northbound during rush hour? I was on the entrance ramp at 114th south for 25 minutes & that was just the beginning. You have to provide early warning of these closures so people can plan accordingly. There is a sign on Bangerter northbound near 90th south warning of trucks leaving the highway. If you can go to the effort to place that signed, a major closure during rush hour should also be provided to commuters.	Signage

A large pot hole in front of  Gilly's Convenience Store. I was headed East on Center Street and turned left on to State Street and then in to Gilly's to get gas as I was headed off of the road I hit a large deep pothole. It damaged my tire and rim. I am tired of the potholes on the State Roads in Emery County. The expense to drive them is getting expensive. I just had to get my car realigned after traveling through the repavement construction on Highway 10 between Huntington and Castle Dale due to numerous potholes. Now going to get gas I have to buy a new tire and rim due to another pothole on Highway 10. I just want the State Road to do their job. They have a large pile of rotomill in their yard in Emery. They could carry some in the back of their truck and fill the potholes until they can be repaired. I pay my taxes and feel that the potholes should be repaired and not left to be hit while driving down the road. The large pothole is on the side of the north bond lane on the side of the road where the inlet and outlet of Gilly's meet the pavement. it is large and deep and should be filled in. I did not see it while turning in, but it sounded like I hit a curb which I knew was not the case as there is not one even close to where I turned in. The pothole looks like it has been there for a long time and I am sure I am not the only one who has hit it before. PLEASE get this pothole repaired!!!	Pothole

On 6/11 I contracted the town to advise that the timing of the light at the bottom of the Circ is causing problems. I was told the work being done by the state would fix that timing.  It didn’t.  Just like last year, the Circ was completely empty for essex residents commuting, while Colchester commuters sat in 10-15 minutes of traffic in the 50 MPH zone before you reach the Circ on Rt 2A. This also causes a backup on Gentes rd as the flow has been restricted. This needs to be addressed as I stated back in June and is a terrible way to treat your neighboring town residents.

2 or 3 weeks ago a tree limb fell (although neighbor claims he saw construction crew knocked into it with their equipment, knocking it down) from a tree inside the fence and on the construction development property.  Thus week the crew dragged it off of the development property and dumped it on the right of way trailhead and gas left it there.  When will they remove this very large tree limb? It has full Madrona leaves on it and is quite large, taking up almost the entire pathway.  As this tree limb fell on the development property i side their fencing, is it Clark Construction responsibility to remover it instead of just dragging it off of their property and dumping it somewhere else?

Due to the CRT closure for erosion repair, bicycle traffic westbound is diverted off the trail at Riverview Park. Travel is along the sidewalk adjacent to Highway 169. Cyclist must then travel through the Community Center over the footbridge to reconnect with the trail under I405. I am a regular daily all-weather commuter. I travel West before 5am. I have great lights. I was not anticipating the gap in the grate. I am fortunate that I am an experienced cyclist with good equipment that I only sustained some damage to my wheel and bruising on my hands. There is a high likelihood one can experience a permanent brain injury from a wheel entrapment obstacle such as this by being ejected over the handlebars. Please repair soon as traffic will be increasing due to the trail closure. There is another grate on the eastbound direction is the same location with a similar gap.	Park Issue

The traffic lights are not timed on WB 169 at the Sherie’s Intersection, 405 ramp, Sunset Blvd, Park Ave, and 2nd and Main. I’ve been driving this route for years, and I believe this problem was created when you redesigned the intersection at 2nd and Main a couple years ago. If you’re at the light at Sherie’s for example you can only make the next green light at 405 if you’re the first car and you floor it. This is definitely a safety problem, and it creates congestion. Please time the lights on WB 169 coming into Renton. Also the light at 154th and WB 169 also has a problem. Between 2:30pm and 3:00pm it might only let three vehicles through before turning Yellow. I’ve noticed this issue for the last month or so. Please increase the time of the green light. Now that I think about it I do remember seeing a crew out there last Summer. If I had known they were going to shorten the time of the green light I would have said something.	Traffic Signal Issue

They break into vehicles, laundry rooms, knock and kick on people's doors in the middle of the night, sleep in hallways and elevators terrorizing the neighborhood. Police drive by occasionally talk to them and do nothing (most of the time don't even stop) they go back to doing what they do which includes attacking citizens (took the police 1hr to show up the other day on report of assault), braking the glass at the bus stop on 144th right next to the park NUMEROUS times, called police they never showed up. They're very well aware of the situation that is happening here yet are doing ZERO about it. Waste of tax dollars! I don't know what it's going to take for this problem to be resolved, people living around this park do not sleep because of this very serious issue. City of tukwila tore down the motels and released all these drug addicts and criminals out on the streets for regular people do deal with them with no help from the police or the city whatsoever.

At the intersection of Harris Rd SE and SE Lund Ave there is a vacant lot on the right hand side. It has some grass growing in the ROW we believe that is causing a site distance issue.

I know this is not an issue for the majority of the citizens, but as the weather grows colder it is very important that the handicap spaces remain accessible to those that the spaces are intended for. They are not intended for the youth of Milwaukee to have a quick parking space Just this week I went to the olive garden to pick up food for my Disabled spouse and I parked in the proper take out spot. As I was walking in i had noticed that all the spots in the handicap area were filled with cars without the proper handicap identification.2 of the cars that parked there pulled in at the time i was walking in. One car even parked in the lined out space which is there to provide more space for a van. The individuals waled in to order to go orders. When I asked them about the spots they were in i was told to mind my own business. Please help keeping the spots free. thank you	Other

The pavement condition of Runway Drive between Prince Road and Gardner Lane is horrible.  It is full of potholes and poorly made patches.  It is so rough that heavy vehicles travel at half of the posted speed to keep their doors from literally falling off.  This is a safety concern as passenger vehicles pass them all the time.  Please program a mill and replace for this roadway before ADOT starts the Ruthrauff Interchange as it will undoubtedly see much more traffic once that starts.  It also floods during storms and the condition of the pavement makes travel even more treacherous during those conditions.	Pothole

The issue is the residents in a fourplex of the neighborhood refuse to use ALL 3 of their trash bins and choose to overpile the 1 that is closest to the driveway. By wind or when people pile more trash and other trash falls out and is left; there is trash all over the street and blowing into yards. This happens every single week and is very frustrating. The overpiling trash is the view we have as soon as you turn onto Bermuda and the stench come the weekend  (pickup is Monday) is absolutely disgusting. I have called code enforcement several times, and the water/trash company and nothing has improved. The situation is escalating and I am not sure what to do anymore.	Litter
Same issue, new week. Trash bags are on the floor around empty bins along with mattress set, boxes, loose trash. Code Enforcement has been called -nothing done. City of Tucson called -nothing done. Crazy that this is a residential street in the City of Tucson and no one cares! Maybe if it were in Sam Hughes neighborhood something would have been done but not in DodgeFlower. There are good people that live here and care about the neighborhood and try to work with officials but receive zero support. How do we keep ALL of Tucson clean and beautiful if we have residential properties that are continually in violation but are not reprimanded??	Litter

Same issue different week. The trash containers for this complex are located on Bermuda Street, a residential street. However, the residents at this complex abuse the trash containers. They leave the containers overfilled with loose trash to spill into the street, dump their unused furniture (see mattresses for the 2nd week in a row, and the bins are used as a dumpsite for a landscaping business, and anyone else who drives up ( see mini containers now left too). I have contacted code enforcement 4 weeks straight-NOTHING DONE! I've contacted the city, who I believe had last week's mattresses removed, but as you can see nothing was done to keep the residents to continue to treat the neighborhood street as their personal dump!! The city needs to enforce an area inside the complex to keep their trash since the complex can't learn to properly throw out their trash per the city of Tucson's rules and regulations!!!	Litter

However, in my opinion, it is difficult to see these ""designated pedestrian crossings"" and the roadway should be painted for improved visibility and safety...if a little paint can save a life and any money associated from potential lawsuits from the crossing not being painted, I think it is worth it...Thanks."

Tractor tire directly accross from Tidewater Boating Center	Illegal Dumping
There is a speed bump here at the Tidewater boating center, which is either on the Bay Trail, or on a connector used by many bicycles to get on it. This speedbump is short and severe, in the shadow of a tree, and its paint is completely worn off. I hit it without seeing it, and almost fell off my bike in a way that would like have caused me to break an arm, wrist, or my skull. I barely managed to hang onto my handlebars.  I spoke to an East Bay parks employee here who said that she has seen three people crash there on bicycles and has had to administer first aid to some of them. This is an immediate and urgent issue to have this repainted to avoid injury to bicyclists. It also, longer-term, should be made into a longer broader speedbump so that if a bicyclist doesn't see it they don't wreck.	Streets - Street Deterioration

There are two vehicles that are parked  on the street between East 23rd street and East 22nd on 11th Avenue. These two cars are there for weeks and is becoming a nuisance. They are not moved and both of these vehicles seems to have no ownership because they do not have California license plates. One vehicle is early model Honda Accord 4 door sedan. It is dark blue color.  It has parking tickets attached to the windshield. It has several dents and one of the window is left opened. The other vehicle is a tan gold color early model Jaguar 4 door sedan. This vehicle has been sitting here for weeks. It is hogging the parking space. It is a eye sore to see this vehicle here. The owner or owners seems to neglect the vehicle to leave it on the street for weeks. Again, these vehicles have no license plates. I would like to see them get towed away. I have been trying to find the owners but no luck. I would like to see parking enforcement take care of this issue  as soon as possible. My neighbors are also disappointed in this matter. We may advance this matter to city hall if there is no action by the end of this month of May 2018.	Parking - Enforcement

The Oakland Coliseum is blasting loud amplified music and setting off extremely loud fireworks that can be heard as far away as the south shore of Alameda. Residents of Alameda are being exposed to high decibel noise that is so loud it can be heard miles away late at night while they are trying to sleep. This is a violation of Alameda County Ordinance 6.60.050 and California Civil Code section 1941.1 and California Health and Safety Code sections 17920.3 and 17920.10. Multiple noise complaints filed with Alameda Police, Oakland Police and voicemails left on Coliseum voicemail system (they never answer their phones, even during their advertised business hours.) This is not the first time they've done this. There was a news story in a bay area newspaper a few years ago documenting over 1,500 noise complaints received from residents of various bay area cities about the noise at the coliseum. This is not the first and probably not the last time they've done this. They are creating a massive nuisance to bay area residents across the east bay and must be held accountable. Please cite the Oakland Coliseum for violating county ordinance and state law, disturbing the peace at late hours at night	Other City Services
Twice within the past month, I've tried to turn left from fifth Avenue onto the Embarcadeo, only to find a car facing me head on. This construction is kind of a mess. Because the old street paint looks like the new street paint when there's a glare. You literally cannot tell what lines are old and new. Trucks are confused, bikers are confused… this construction needs to be moved forward.  The street narrowing for construction is a bad situation. Please hurry up and fix this section of the Embarcadero so the road can be opened up properly. That means regaining a turn lane and a bike lane. Thank you! Ps: you can see in that photo where the word STOP is painted on the ground… That's where I almost had the two head on collisions. Traffic now goes the opposite way there!

Please install lights at Temescal Creek Park. Although the park is open until 9pm, the sun sets so early in the wintertime that the park is unusable in the early evenings. During the summer, the park is usually busy between 5 and 8 p.m., but between November and March, park users who work until 5 p.m. are unable to enjoy the park with their friends, children, and dogs after work. A few lights near the playground, basketball court, and dog run would make Temescal Creek Park safer and more accessible for everyone.	Park Issue

at the very end of Jean St by 580 freeway.  There is a storm drain, which I have kept clear of debris, however, on the opposite side of the chain link fence (and the storm drain grate) that separates Jean Street from the slope leading down to the freeway the cement drain is full of debris.  Some left by Mother Nature (leaves, Ivy, etc) and some left by humans who have tossed it over the fence.  This storm drain starts at Chetwood  and continues down past Crescent St. and empties out at the end of Santa Clara where the on ramp to 580 is.  With all the rain we've had and the rain yet to come the ability for the storm drains to handle the water coming from the streets is certainly limited.  Note:  There is an entrance gate at the end of Jean street so one can gain access to this area but it has a large link chain on it and a padlock so you will have to find whoever has the key or bring something to cut the lock off with.

What it Oakland's plan for enforcement of the new BRT Bus lanes along International Blvd.  There is a very dangerous situation now where Left Turn Only lanes have been set up, crossing over the BRT lanes.  There is ZERO enforcement of the BRT lanes so cars are currently using it as an express lane (60MPH+) to get around slower traffic in the single lane roadway, completely ignoring the red red light arrow above the lane. This means that someone using the Left Turn lane is literally risking their life to make a left turn (especially on a motorcycle).  Something needs to be done IMMEDIATELY before someone dies along this stretch of roadway!	Street Light (Not Traffic Signal) - Outage/Damaged

This car's license plate is 7CNN287 and it has been parked in the same spot for at least 4 months taking up neighbors parking. There are plants/weeds growing on the car. On street sweeping days, parking reinforcement staff doesn't seem to be issuing parking tickets either but I may be wrong. Neighbors have been unsuccessful getting in contact with the city. An online request was submitted one month ago via the online City of Oakland city request (reference 590096 was issued) but the city hasn't responded. If you can send someone to look into this it would be awesome!	Other: Other City Services

Hi.  Not sure if this is the correct place to voice a complaint. The city is currently working on my street and today left a metal plate over the hole they are working on. Every time a car drives over it, it makes a very loud sound. It’s so loud that it’s causing my household sleeping issues as our bedrooms are on the street and it has woken us up. I u nderstand that this is a temporary situation but am hoping it can be fixed asap so we don’t have more sleepless nights! Thank you!	Streets/Sidewalks - Curb & Gutter Repair

The pothole/decaying pavement that was just repaired at the corner of Pinehaven and Broadway Terrace has already, in just a few days, started to sink again, making it once more a thing to be avoided, because of the potential damage to front-end alignment and tires.

The timing of the traffic signal at Air Cargo Way and Ron Cowan Parkway in Oakland is off.  As soon as a car driving on Air Cargo Way reaches the intersection, the light turns green, even if cars on Ron Cowan Parkway had a green light for only seconds.  This could lead to traffic safety issues as cars driving on Ron Cowan at 45 mph must make frequent and unexpected stops.	Traffic Safety (non-emergency)
Timing is off for traffic signal at intersection of Air Cargo Way and Ron Cowan Parkway.  As soon as a car on Air Cargo Way appears at the intersection, the traffic signal changes to green for that car, even if cars on Ron Cowan Parkway have had a green light for only seconds.

I would like to see some signage -- at least a YIELD sign -- at the top of High where it intersects with Tompkins, warning drivers making a left onto Tompkins that traffic coming from the right does not stop. Currently there is nothing. People drive pretty fast along Tompkins from Carlson to High, and visibility is not good because of the planted median.  For anyone unfamiliar with how the intersection works, it's quite dangerous; since High is the greater thoroughfare, when drivers reach the High-Tompkins' T they assume they have the right-of-way.

The 2 street lights at the NE corner of Seminary and International, kitty corner from Los Dos Gallos restaurant, are out again. Could it be that the light-sensing set up, that I imagine is what enables the lights to automatically come on and go off, is not properly set? I'm wondering if the ambient light from traffic and street and signal lights from other corners are causing these lights to either not come on at all or go off while it's still dark. I have not seen this corner in the evening, only in the early mornings. Can something be done so they are consistently on when it's dark? I've only seen them on one morning, right after I last reported the issue.	Street Light (Not Traffic Signal) - Outage/Damaged

Late at night people are going into the ravine on Oak Hill Road close to where it intersects with Sequoyah Road. I have seen drug usage on the road there, but cannot see what else is going on inside the area. People are going into the ravine at odd hours in complete darkness, from 10:30 PM onwards. The land there is steep, so it's also not conducive for road pit stops, amorous couples and the like. What could be going on there? I strongly feel that the unlit, unmonitored area is a security risk for our neighborhood.	Other: Other City Services

The street is crumbling and causing large holes (larger than an ordinary pothole) all along the street.  This kicks up lots of gravel as cars drive by (since the street is crumbling into pieces).  After the rains this month, there was a lot of standing water pooling in the holes (again, these holes are large; some are 5-10 feet long) and consequently a lot of mosquitoes.  I'm not sure if the holes need to be filled or the street repaved.  Either way, it is a mess to keep clean, it is dangerous because there is debris kicked up by passing cars (kids have been hit in the face with flying rocks), and the excess water sitting in these pools is unhealthy.  Thank you for your time.	Street/Traffic Issue (Other than Pothole)

Yesterday, the pothole area flooded with water because of an unrelated water issue. The picture shows what happens when it rains. The last paving job made a paving block in the gutter where the water flows down the street to the drain. Water pools at the pothole because of the pavement flaw.  This is contributing to the increased deterioration of the pavement around the pothole.	Streets - Potholes/Depression

Last night, January 2, a group of taggers used white and black spray paint and tagged the sidewalk in the alley lane between Church Avenue and Del Mar.  The majority of  the graffiti gang-like tags are in the north section of the alley, closer to E Street.  The taggers have spray-painted most of the trash and recycle cans, too.  They also tagged a concrete block fence with black spray paint. It would help for police to increase patrol units in the alley lane to curb tagging activity at night and at dawn.  Most important, please schedule removal of the tags on the sidewalks in the alley lane and also on the sidewalk at 221 Church Avenue.

As I crossed the street I looked back at the traffic officer who was now trying to park in the red zone in front of a fire hydrant.  I approached the officer and asked why he had honked at me and he replied very rudely ""I was in his way and that he didn't have time to talk to me"". I asked for his name and badge number.  He refused to give his name or allow me to see his badge. I began to take pictures of his vehicle parked blocking the fire hydrant and he later yelled his badge number of #270. I believe his actions warrant disciplinary actions. Please feel free to contact me regarding this matter. Thank you.  Vehicle plate number  #1028709"	Park Requests

Please have it fixed ASAP and stop wasting water.	Park Requests

I have lived here several months as a tenant. We are not allowed to possess any self-defense items like guns or other intentional weapons. There have been several nights when someone has knocked on my door and hidden but I have been able to view it was a male and that the direct response to my inquiry the first time was denied; and the second time, I did not respond to the knocking. The premises here are not safe (these have been late evening after 10 pm unwelcome knocking). Anyone without an access code can be present since there is no monitoring (only a concierge that often is not present at the front). There should be cameras situated on the floors for safety. Or we should have access to a number for the concierge to confirm any unwelcome visitors.	Housing Conditions

They have finally run the shorter fence to the front but still have a section that is not only at the front but also still as high as the gutters.  It was our understanding that you can not have a fence 1) running to the front of your house and 2) as high as this one.  Why are they allowed to have this?  I know other neighbors have called on this same property.	Private Property Issue

I take my kids to Dixie Heights. My route is to take Lyndale, make a left on to Dixie. We get a green arrow to turn left and cars try to go but kids do not obey the traffic signs and walk.  We barely get any cars thru turning left and I have seen kids come running thru the crosswalk when we have a green arrow. Kids may get hit. I see this everyday. The other lights at the Dudley intersection have the green arrows at the end of the light cycle. Wondering if the cycle of the green arrow at Lyndale can be changed to the end as well to prevent any accidents and allow cars to turn left with no kids walking.	Traffic Sign Missing or Needs Repair

I take exit 7 every day to go to work, like thousands of others.  A few weeks ago, I got side swiped from a car in a hit and run (police report filed).  But even before my accident, and many times since then, I've seen the same exact thing almost happen to many others because there are no lanes painted on the road.  There are faded arrows painted but during busy hours, cars are covering them.  There are signs overhead by the lights, but no one seems to look there.  To my understanding, there are 4 lanes:  far left turns left onto Marginal, middle two lanes go straight on Franklin, and the far right turns right onto Marginal.  Having dotted lines going through the intersection to show which lanes go straight would prevent the issue tremendously.  The same thing happens up at the Whole Foods intersection, but not quite as bad.  Please fix this!!  I'm sure I'm not the only one that doesn't want to risk getting my car hit every time I come into work.  With the amount of tourists driving around here nowadays, not everyone knows how this area works.  Thank you!!	Paint Street Lines

This is the third of fourth time we've had to post about this road. Its been neglected and there are huge potholes that fill with water during every storm. Now that it is winter time, they are creating huge sheets of ice. It is a safety concern and I fear that someone will fall or get into a car accident. Back in July someone assessed the road and said it was going to be fixed by the winter time for this very reason. Now it is December and the problem hasn't been fixed. This problem needs to be addressed before someone really hurts themselves.	Road Maintenance
The whole street especially the left side has several holes that are getting deeper and deeper. There is tons of standing water every time it rains and for days after. Cars keep hydroplaning and the water is attracting large amounts of mosquitoes and bugs. I reported this a few months ago and they came to patch the biggest hole, and said they were returning to fix it and never did. It needs to be done before winter or else the whole street will have layers of ice again.	Road Maintenance

We have been denied a permit for a driveway because our house is located on a corner and the engineer Robert Murphy told us that we need to leave 50 feet from the curb and at the end of those 50ft there is a storm drain. So Mr. Murphy told us that only seven feet would remain for us to have a driveway. We are asking if it is possible for us to have an entrance for a driveway on wellham Avenue instead? There is a guard rail on that side of Wellham Ave. We told Mr. Murphy that we are asking for this entrance for a driveway because my wife Carmen Johanna Santiago is a handicapped person.

The speed limit on wellham ave is 30. People do atleast 40+ down this residential road. I have almost been hit several time backing into my driveway because people are speeding and not paying attention. I see people pass people on the wrong side of the road because they aren't going fast enough. I see people use Wellham as a drag strip. I even have video camera infront of my house and you can see how fast people are going. Something needs to be done to maintain the speed on this road before a child gets hit, since this is a residential neighborhood. There is a school and several parks off Wellham so there are away kids by this road. The county shouldn't wait until someone gets hurt or killed before they act, they need to do something about the speed sooner then later.	Road Maintenance

7876 Mansion House Crossing has garbage piled up alongside the residence. This causing our neighborhood to see rats, mice, opossums and raccoons. We have never had this problem before. They also park motor vehicles on their front lawn. The tan vehicle pictured does not run. Finally they have a large camper that does not move parked and taking up several parking spaces. Isn’t there a county ordinance that makes people move there vehicles every 48 hours. This residence is a nusience in our neighborhood and is bringing down our property values. I have attached photos and would appreciate any assistance you can offer. Thank you very very much.	Trash, Garbage or Refuse
By installing speed humps at a modest height, as they have installed on Notely and the other side of Chesterfield this will help to prevent the excessive speed motorists are freely abusing on a daily basis. I find it disgusting that I have to put up with people using the straightway of my road as a 1320 drag strip to show off how loud their supped up car goes to impress NO ONE. It is ridiculous that every time we as a community try to have speed humps and awareness to the police we are shut down for NO GOOD REASON!

The road of Mansion House Xing/ Notely Road has become a freeway filled with speeders and people who disobey the stop signage who use this road as a cut through to Duvall highway which makes a residential road a HIGHWAY in itself. Since installing surveillance cameras I have witnessed on a daily basis 900-1000 motorist passing my house throughout all hours of day and night. Thought there are some safe drivers, people abuse this area and excessively speed, tailgate, and perform moving violations to avoid being on the main roads because they're either high/ drunk or a combination of both. I've lived here for 30 years and this road has gotten progressively worse. There are children, runners, and families of all ages who use the cross walks and I fear one day will be RAN DOWN because everyone uses this road as a highway.

As noted in request #7409259, the poles at this intersection serve absolutely no purpose other than to make turning more difficult.

Please at least explain why they are there if they are going to remain. What problem are they solving?	Traffic Signs

What is the purpose of the 3 poles that were placed on Dairy Farm, right where cars turn in from Waugh Chapel Road? It can't be for parking reasons, as there is a fire hydrant there making parking illegal anyway.

They've been knocked down at least once, and I predict they will continue to be knocked down. Please just remove them.	Traffic Signs

Started project with work going on for over 3 plus days where they didn't have a silt fence in place and up to this date they still do not have a porta potty on site as well. Jobsite is very unprofessional just in these early stages let alone a month or few down the road. Once again these trees are leaning towards our home and have already hit the home.	Building Violation

The usual pure compost odor caused by a temperature inversion with no wind. The smell infiltrates into the neighborhood. I see the standard response you send. I have lived with this odor on and off even before WeCare. We sued the city and won, there is an outstanding court order that WeCare violates on almost a daily basis.sending noxious odors into the neighborhood. There is no amount of study that will eliminate this odor. The only option is to shut down WeCare and dismantle the composting facility. The City has been out maneuvered by the WeCare lawyers. It is time to get serious and shut down the facility or risk another law suit.	Odor Complaint

For what it's worth, I also saw this intersection reported by a reader in the Marlborough Patch online. Has there ever been a study of the traffic in this intersection?

Hall Avenue has multiple deep potholes. These are primarily caused by the heavy trucks and government services vehicles e.g. heavy USPS trucks that use Hall Ave rather than go through the nightmare of the square's traffic pattern. These trucks often exceed the residential speed limit. Medford contacts have told us verbally that Hall Avenue is a private road and that potholes are a responsibility of the residents. But if this is true, why are there no signs and no speed or access enforcement? There should be NO vehicles over 2 axles or 6000 lbs gross weight here if that's the case. Holding these few residents accountable to fix an issue caused by the insane traffic pattern a few streets over is insanity. The resolution should be for the city to fix the road, put in proper private road / no thru traffic signage, enforce private access and speed limit on this road to prevent further damage to our private way. The government of Medford and the USPS are using this road heavily and with heavy vehicles and should be held accountable to fix.	Pothole

"This intersection requires a SECOND 'safe' stopping zone for traffic entering from both Church and Orchard Streets. Achieved with a second Stop Sign, and corresponding Stop Line painted on pavement, along with a short run of Double Yellow Line leading up to Stop Line from Orchard Street entrance. This would encourage a safer approach for vehicles attempting to enter onto Common St and discourage those vehicles entering into this intersection from Orchard and Church Streets from having to stop, as they do now, dead in the middle of the intersection in 'no man's land', as they attempt to seek a safe merge window. The addition of 2 signs at the Church St entrance to intersection, 1) ""Left and Right Turn Only"" (Left & Right arrows) and, 2) ""Oncoming Traffic Does Not Stop"", would also help to deter these vehicles from going straight into 'no man's land' area."

I've just noticed a series of street lights in my neighborhood have been off for a week now. Furnace brook parkway is a very busy street and many times cars are speeding down. I believe it's a safety hazard, please turn them back on.	Street Lights
I was wondering why the guard rail replacement project on Furnace Brook Pkwy. hasn't been completed yet? It was started in the summer and they finished the section between Southern Artery and Quincy Shore Drive and have only completed part of the section between Hancock St. And Southern Artery.  What's the status of this and when will it be completed. It looks like a half @#$% job.	Sidewalk/Street Repair

Construction noise at this site has been constant and in violation of the City’s good neighbor policy since commencement of this project. Noise from the site can be regularly heard as early as 6am and as late as 11:30pm. Generally noise from the site extends into the evening daily (past 7pm). Most recently Saturday (10/15/16) I was awoken by loud beeping coming from this site at 6:45am. This particular noise sounds like the beeping produced by a truck or bus backing up, however the beeping continues all day without a break. This is not the first time the constant beeping has been present, but it was particularly disturbing on this occasion because I had the rare opportunity to sleep in.  I understand that vehicles engaged in such work require safety features like beeping to alert those nearby of danger. However, the beeping never stops, so its purpose certainly cannot be to alert those in the area of danger. The beep is gratuitous at best.  I understand the same developers are seeking to develop two adjacent parcels to this site. This is very concerning given the lack of respect the developers and their contractors have shown to the neighborhood during the course of this current project by permitting loud, noisy, and intrusive work to completed at all of hours of the day, often 7 days a week.

Road Kill on Melvin St between 18 and 10	Trash & Recycling
Our trash was not collected today, but our neighbors at 5A did have theirs taken, so somehow it just got overlooked. Any way to have it done tomorrow? I'm going to keep curbside for now. It's full, so I can't go another week. Thanks!	Trash & Recycling

Pothole in middle of street at approximately 11 Western Ave.  It is about 18 inches by 18 inches and 3 or 4 inches deep.  Thank you	Pothole
There was no option for other for trash complaint. Last week the trash service knocked over all our recycling when putting the barrel back down and left it strewn across the street. This morning the barrels were all knocked over and ours was broken as a result of this poor trash service.  Our current trash service is horrible. there is no attentiveness to leaving a clean work environment. Barrels are regularly left in the middle of the road after they pick up the trash. They are always left knocked over as well. The town should fire the current provider.	Trash & Recycling
The animals splattered in the road look awful. CLEAN IT. Either the DPW should or the Animal Control officer should. Do not leave it to decompose on our roads.	Trash & Recycling
The town has a lot of roadkill. It would be nice if someone from either the DPW or Animal Control was out picking it up. It looks and smells DISGUSTING.	Trash & Recycling
The dead animals in the road smell so bad and it is disgusting to go over them when they are right in the middle of the road. Let's get the DPW or Animal Control out to clean it.	Trash & Recycling
Central Street in recent years has increasingly become a cut through street for traffic in morning rush hour on Route 62 heading toward West Concord and Route 2. When traffic begins to back up at the Pine St/Rte 62 light, drivers turn right off 62 onto Brown St and then left Central St where they then gun their engines and drive at very high speeds down Central. I live at 273 Central St and for the last 20 minutes dozens of cars have been doing this. It is worst between 8-9 am. This is a neighborhood of many children walking and biking to school and the high speeds of these cut through drivers is dangerous and disruptive. It would help if the Concord police would periodically be a visible presence near the Brown St/Central St intersection or on Brown near Rte 62 to deter cut through driving and ticket those who are speeding. Also it would help to put up signs prohibiting cut through traffic between 7:30 -9:30 am and posting speed limit at 20 mph. I've lived in this house for many years and this problem didn't exist until several years ago. Please help.	Other
