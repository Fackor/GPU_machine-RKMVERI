Hello. In the Morning between the hours of 7am and 10am the green light traffic signals headed Northbound and Southbound are way to short.  When the morning commute comes in the traffic backs up along 5th east and blocks driveways and creates other co gestion problems.  Sometimes it can take 20 minutes to get inbetween 500 Soth through 400 south. The green light needs to be at least 5 seconds longer. It would get us through the light much faster and avoid frustration, road-rage, dangerous situations and congestion.	Traffic Signals

Length of Green Light has shortened in last week  and is causing backing south of intersection	Traffic Signals
Several times in recent days I have sat at the southbound left turn onto 1300 S, attempting to head east into the St. Mary's neighborhood and have sat through 2-4 cycles of lights. Finally I have exited the lane and turned at the next intersection. Several other neighbors that I asked have experienced the same issue. The city recently blocked traffic from making left turns from Laird Way on to 1300 S, even for local residents, which is forcing all traffic to turn at the light that is not functioning.  I have witnessed multiple people pulling erratic U turns, turning left on the red light when it is clear, or cutting back into heavy traffic. This is getting dangerous and needs to be addressed. The sensors do not seem to be working correctly.	Traffic Signals
"My apologies for bothering you with a relatively mundane traffic issue, but I drive my kids to school each weekday, and almost without fail, cars block the intersection (facing northbound) on Foothill Drive and 1300 S. making it difficult for those heading west to make the short light. Not sure that a ""Do Not Block Intersection"" sign would make any significant difference, but might be worth trying? : )"	Signage
The light for a left turn from northbound Foothill Drive to westbound 1300 S has an extremely long wait time on Sunday mornings, when there is very little opposing traffic. A yield light or shorter cycle would be helpful. I fully understand that left turns must be fully protected during evening commute hours due to traffic patterns and high accident rates.

south bound traffic turning left has a long waite and therefor there is increased traffic through Laird Way residential street if the turn light was green more often and longer it would decrease cut through traffic.  PLEASE fix this I live on this street.	Traffic Signals

Snow removal from city sidewalks - I am a resident of Shokoe Bottom and have the ability to utilize public transportation or walk to go to and from work. Today I chose to walk - as I ventured from my home I realized very quickly the sidewalks have not been cleared!  CVS on the corner of 25th & Main had a path for pedestrians but what was shocking was Farm Fresh had not cleared the sidewalk!  Not only had they not cleared the sidewalk but there wasn't any snow in their parking lot which was filled with cars!  The snow stopped on Saturday and on Tuesday morning there is no path for people to walk!  As I continued on my walk to work I continued to have to walk thru un-shoveled paths on Main Street!  Honey Whytes, Whisk, Station 3, Southern Kitchen, Sweet Teas and the Amtrak station did an exceptional job of clearing the sidewalks for pedestrians - why aren't businesses being cited for violating the Richmond City Code 90-42 which mandates sidewalks must be cleared with 6 hours of snow stoppage!   The government managed to remove snow from all walkways I had no trouble walking on the sidewalks once I entered government property!	Other

People to want to come to Richmond from all over to see things like the monuments and various other aspects of our history. Just a suggestion, I think that probably what needs to be done is to put up some signs, on the Confederate monuments, which say that these were placed here by people of another era and different perspectives. We do not endorse what they stood for, in their civil war actions, we simply leave them as a reminder of what happened back then and as a warning to present and future generations. Having said something like that, the state and city and various interested groups could work on making Monument Avenue really live up to its name. Monument Avenue is a very long avenue. There is room there for many future monuments. The Ashe Monument was a good start for non-Confederate monuments. There are many people and groups who would be worthy of memorializing with monuments, statues, etc. along Monument Avenue in between the Confederate monuments and on past them all the way out to Horsepen Road in Henrico County. Handled tastefully, Monument Avenue could become a wonder to behold and a much more positive representation of the Richmond area and of Virginia's history.	Other

When I commute to work via bicycle, my route takes me across Mayo's Bridge. The storm drain grates on the bridge are extremely dangerous to ride over because they're installed inches below the level of the asphalt. This would not be a problem if I could safely ride to the left of the grates, but drivers routinely exceed the speed limit by 10 or 15 miles per hour, and they often don't give other bicyclists and me the mandated two feet of space they're supposed to do. My dilemma becomes riding over the dangerously uneven storm drains, or running the risk of being plowed down by several tons of speeding metal. Please, please, PLEASE enforce the speed limit on Mayo's Bridge. Better yet, enforce the speed limit and reduce it to 25 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on either end of the bridge. I invite any police officers assigned to this area to ride with me one morning or evening to experience my commute.	Other
I am a sometime bicycle commuter, and my way to work takes me across Mayo's Bridge, continuing south on Hull Street to Belt Boulevard. The road on the bridge is in terrible shape, and the storm drain grates are so poorly installed that I have to avoid them by riding further in the traffic lane than I ordinarily would. This wouldn't be a huge problem if drivers obeyed the speed limit going across the bridge. Unfortunately, they don't. I routinely observe drivers doing 40 or 50 miles per hour across the bridge. It's completely unsafe, both for those of us observing the laws AND the people who flout them. Riding across the Mayo Bridge in that kind of traffic can be a terrifying experience. I don't believe it should be. Please do something permanent to get drivers to observe the speed limit (and why not reduce the speed limit across the bridge to 25, as it is Downtown and in Manchester). Please don't wait for another bicycle injury or fatality to address this and other safety issues.	Other
Yesterday we walked the dog from the Northside of 14th street and across the bridge to the south side of the James on 14th street to check out the Slave trail footpaths.  I couldn't even navigate my dog out of all of the broken glass to get him across safely. There was tons of garbage especially in front of the Mayo Island area and someone's been living and throwing garbage right under the bridge which is in plain view when walking across. I was surprised this area was not better maintained as it is currently well travelled and will become more so as the Manchester area develops.  Please send a crew to get this area cleaned.  My guess is that it hasn't been cleaned in a long long time.  Thank you.	Trash/Bulk Pick-ups

Since the hurricane the traffic light at the intersection of Stony Point Pkwy at the entrance to the Fashion Mall is not operating properly.  Very long delays even when there is no traffic.	Non-functioning Traffic Lights
I live in a town home community behind Stony Point Fashion Mall.  The only access in and out of the area is Chippenham Pkwy. which means we can neither walk or ride a bicycle, moped, etc, out of the area.  In other words if you don't have a regular vehicle you're trapped.  There is no other way out even for emergency purposes.  This is true for the fashion mall as well as a large office park located at the same exit.  There are several chained and locked gates in the general areas but they are located on private property.

Light at Chippenham South and Stony Point Parkway has now been elongated so much that 4 o'clock traffic leaving office /medical buildings back up to light exiting northbound Chippenham. And 5 o'clock traffic is backed up from left turn onto Chippenham south to intersection at MCV medical center blocking people trying to go North on Chippenham. And giving people exiting office building difficulty getting into left turn lane for Chippenham south. Waited 1 min 15 seconds yesterday for left turn light onto Chippenham with little traffic going to or exiting SP Fashion Park. Again, this is as dangerous as long unneeded left turn and exit lights (other than rush hour) on Huguenot at Stony Point Rd and Chippenham south exit. People get anxious and speed or weave in and out. Who has messed up all these lights? 2 minutes sitting at 5:45am to exit Stony Point Rd onto Huguenot. Another 40 plus seconds at Chippenham south exit for little or no traffic in am? It's just plain dumb! All these lights were fine before power outage 2 (?) years ago. And now they just keep getting worse each time they play with them.	Traffic light

Big Deep Pot hole, Address: 2200 Magnolia Street, Richmond, VA, 23223. Just after crossing Magnolia Ct. in the farthest right hand lane of Magnolia Street going south bound towards the Magnolia and Mechanicsville Trpk intersection. The pot hole is so big, it bent the rim on my passenger side front, I could not avoid hitting it, it is that big. I hit the pot hole last night 1-3-11 at approx. 5:20PM and reported it to VDOT who told me to report it to you all. I hope some one will come out very soon and fix the pot hole so that no one else hits it. Looking forward to some progress. Thanks, Monetha Whitney	Potholes

The Railroad crossing on N. Hopkins Rd within 2 blocks of Jeff Davis Highway is in bad need of repair.  Most traffic has to slow to a rolling stop to travers the tracks safely; but, the potholes are getting worse in both directions.

A disconcerting number of dead tadpoles in and around the Bryan Park pond. Seems like more involved than the cold snap. Wondering if anyone knows what happened over there - something in the water?	Other
The pond on the southern edge of Bryan Park is significantly drained and stagnant. The fountain has not run at all this spring or summer and has filled with weeds. There is a stench of raw sewage that surrounds the area of the pond. This pond alone could produce enough mosquitoes to plague all of Bellevue, Ginter Park and Battery Park. It is a shame that such a beautiful water feature has been neglected, and considering continued public access to the park, it should be kept in good working order.	Other
The gates to the road access around Bryan Park are being left open again this season and there continue to be individuals parking along the wooded areas toward the back of the Park and sitting in their vehicles starting at 6:30 in the morning.  Based on the history of this Park, this needs to be addressed.  Unauthorized vehicles are not allowed past the soccer field parking area, but these individuals continue to be in this area loitering or watching.  This is a family park.	Other

The Richmond Police Department needs to command this same expectation of their officers.	Other

It is a cesspool of filth including what are probably numerous stolen and broken bicycles.  The area needs to be cleaned up as it is unsanitary.

Please consider paving this gravel area as it is a trip hazard to pedestrians transitioning from the end of the mural section of the canal walk to the asphalt area below.  This area will receive a lot of additional foot traffic during the bike races and would be in the city's best interest to make this safer for all of our guests.	Other

Hello, I have an issue in my neighborhood. The house at 620 Little Neck Rd, 23452 has a blue tarp across the whole roof. It covers the entire roof. It's been on the roof for approximately a month.

Is there anything that you can do to assist with this neighborhood eyesore? We appreciate any assistance provided by the city?  If you have any additional questions, please contact me. Thanks.	Other

LIghts along Kingston Dr are out, making it dangerous to walk at night.	Street Light
Kingston Dr is a cut through street to Kingston Elementary and the back of Kings Grant. The foot traffic in the morning and afternoons contains a high volume of children traveling to and from the school and bus stops. Kinnston Dr also experiences a high volume of cars driving quickly causing the children to move to the grass or gutters of the street to avoid being hit. Even without exceeding the 25mph speed limit it is extremely dangerous for two cars in opposite directions to pass at the same time while children are walking in the street. The speed needs to be reduced during school hours, enforced, or side walks need to provide safer paths for the children.	Other Roadway Issues

"When traveling eastbound on Santa Fe and crossing over the tracks approaching the red light at N Kansas Ave, if a train comes before the light has turned green for those of us on the east side of the tracks, it will not turn green until the train has passed.

I take exit 7 every day to go to work, like thousands of others.  A few weeks ago, I got side swiped from a car in a hit and run (police report filed).  But even before my accident, and many times since then, I've seen the same exact thing almost happen to many others because there are no lanes painted on the road.  There are faded arrows painted but during busy hours, cars are covering them.  There are signs overhead by the lights, but no one seems to look there.  To my understanding, there are 4 lanes:  far left turns left onto Marginal, middle two lanes go straight on Franklin, and the far right turns right onto Marginal.  Having dotted lines going through the intersection to show which lanes go straight would prevent the issue tremendously.  The same thing happens up at the Whole Foods intersection, but not quite as bad.  Please fix this!!  I'm sure I'm not the only one that doesn't want to risk getting my car hit every time I come into work.  With the amount of tourists driving around here nowadays, not everyone knows how this area works.  Thank you!!	Paint Street Lines

We have two green trash cans that always go out with our two recycling cans. Today and a few times in the past the trash has not been emptied. We have a terrible time with raccoons getting into our trash despite several attempts to deter them. This leads to scattered trash and fly infestations. When they are not emptied it makes the situations worse. If there is a reason they are not being emptied, we would like to know so we can fix it. Thank you in advance!	Trash, Garbage or Refuse

This is the third of fourth time we've had to post about this road. Its been neglected and there are huge potholes that fill with water during every storm. Now that it is winter time, they are creating huge sheets of ice. It is a safety concern and I fear that someone will fall or get into a car accident. Back in July someone assessed the road and said it was going to be fixed by the winter time for this very reason. Now it is December and the problem hasn't been fixed. This problem needs to be addressed before someone really hurts themselves.	Road Maintenance
The whole street especially the left side has several holes that are getting deeper and deeper. There is tons of standing water every time it rains and for days after. Cars keep hydroplaning and the water is attracting large amounts of mosquitoes and bugs. I reported this a few months ago and they came to patch the biggest hole, and said they were returning to fix it and never did. It needs to be done before winter or else the whole street will have layers of ice again.	Road Maintenance

We have been denied a permit for a driveway because our house is located on a corner and the engineer Robert Murphy told us that we need to leave 50 feet from the curb and at the end of those 50ft there is a storm drain. So Mr. Murphy told us that only seven feet would remain for us to have a driveway. We are asking if it is possible for us to have an entrance for a driveway on wellham Avenue instead? There is a guard rail on that side of Wellham Ave. We told Mr. Murphy that we are asking for this entrance for a driveway because my wife Carmen Johanna Santiago is a handicapped person.

The speed limit on wellham ave is 30. People do atleast 40+ down this residential road. I have almost been hit several time backing into my driveway because people are speeding and not paying attention. I see people pass people on the wrong side of the road because they aren't going fast enough. I see people use Wellham as a drag strip. I even have video camera infront of my house and you can see how fast people are going. Something needs to be done to maintain the speed on this road before a child gets hit, since this is a residential neighborhood. There is a school and several parks off Wellham so there are away kids by this road. The county shouldn't wait until someone gets hurt or killed before they act, they need to do something about the speed sooner then later.	Road Maintenance

The road of Mansion House Xing/ Notely Road has become a freeway filled with speeders and people who disobey the stop signage who use this road as a cut through to Duvall highway which makes a residential road a HIGHWAY in itself. Since installing surveillance cameras I have witnessed on a daily basis 900-1000 motorist passing my house throughout all hours of day and night. Thought there are some safe drivers, people abuse this area and excessively speed, tailgate, and perform moving violations to avoid being on the main roads because they're either high/ drunk or a combination of both. I've lived here for 30 years and this road has gotten progressively worse. There are children, runners, and families of all ages who use the cross walks and I fear one day will be RAN DOWN because everyone uses this road as a highway.

As noted in request #7409259, the poles at this intersection serve absolutely no purpose other than to make turning more difficult. Parking at that corner is already illegal due to the fire hydrant located there.

Please at least explain why they are there if they are going to remain. What problem are they solving?	Traffic Signs

What is the purpose of the 3 poles that were placed on Dairy Farm, right where cars turn in from Waugh Chapel Road? It can't be for parking reasons, as there is a fire hydrant there making parking illegal anyway.

They've been knocked down at least once, and I predict they will continue to be knocked down. Please just remove them.	Traffic Signs
Over the last few weeks, white bumpers have been installed on Dairy Farm Road at intersection with Waugh Chapel- it is very dangerous now for vehicles attempting a left turn from Dairy Farm as vehicle turning from Waugh Chapel needs to negotiate a turn on a very narrow lane and today I was almost hit by a vehicle turning left from Waugh Chapel when they over corrected.

It is almost impossible to see traffic coming up B and A blvd. This is a huge safety concern and the weird thing is all 4 or 5 houses going in that direction have driveways that could easily fit there vechicles.

Is this the appropriate place to voice concern, or is there another place I can go to voice it? I believe this intersection should be a four-way stop, and the neighbors I've talked to feel similarly. For what it's worth, I also saw this intersection reported by a reader in the Marlborough Patch online. Has there ever been a study of the traffic in this intersection? It seems like putting a four-way stop at this intersection just makes sense for the safety of all.	Traffic Signs

The truck is either a new resident of the condos or constantly visits there daily.  And has started parking there even though there is plenty of parking spaces on Forest street  His truck blocks the view of hall ave and intervale ave. (private ways)  residents cannot pull out safely without putting the nose of their car in the way.  My kids are both good drivers, but I do not want them pulling on to Forest street in the AM.  I want them to go via bradley road to the square.  I pay enough in taxes. My kids and all other drivers should be protected.	Parking related issue

Hall Avenue has multiple deep potholes. These are primarily caused by the heavy trucks and government services vehicles e.g. heavy USPS trucks that use Hall Ave rather than go through the nightmare of the square's traffic pattern. These trucks often exceed the residential speed limit. Medford contacts have told us verbally that Hall Avenue is a private road and that potholes are a responsibility of the residents. But if this is true, why are there no signs and no speed or access enforcement? There should be NO vehicles over 2 axles or 6000 lbs gross weight here if that's the case. Holding these few residents accountable to fix an issue caused by the insane traffic pattern a few streets over is insanity. The resolution should be for the city to fix the road, put in proper private road / no thru traffic signage, enforce private access and speed limit on this road to prevent further damage to our private way. The government of Medford and the USPS are using this road heavily and with heavy vehicles and should be held accountable to fix.	Pothole

"This intersection requires a SECOND 'safe' stopping zone for traffic entering from both Church and Orchard Streets. Achieved with a second Stop Sign, and corresponding Stop Line painted on pavement, along with a short run of Double Yellow Line leading up to Stop Line from Orchard Street entrance. This would encourage a safer approach for vehicles attempting to enter onto Common St and discourage those vehicles entering into this intersection from Orchard and Church Streets from having to stop, as they do now, dead in the middle of the intersection in 'no man's land', as they attempt to seek a safe merge window. The addition of 2 signs at the Church St entrance to intersection, 1) ""Left and Right Turn Only"" (Left & Right arrows) and, 2) ""Oncoming Traffic Does Not Stop"", would also help to deter these vehicles from going straight into 'no man's land' area."

Construction noise at this site has been constant and in violation of the City’s good neighbor policy since commencement of this project. Noise from the site can be regularly heard as early as 6am and as late as 11:30pm. Generally noise from the site extends into the evening daily (past 7pm). Most recently Saturday (10/15/16) I was awoken by loud beeping coming from this site at 6:45am. This particular noise sounds like the beeping produced by a truck or bus backing up, however the beeping continues all day without a break. This is not the first time the constant beeping has been present, but it was particularly disturbing on this occasion because I had the rare opportunity to sleep in.  I understand that vehicles engaged in such work require safety features like beeping to alert those nearby of danger. However, the beeping never stops, so its purpose certainly cannot be to alert those in the area of danger. The beep is gratuitous at best.  I understand the same developers are seeking to develop two adjacent parcels to this site. This is very concerning given the lack of respect the developers and their contractors have shown to the neighborhood during the course of this current project by permitting loud, noisy, and intrusive work to completed at all of hours of the day, often 7 days a week.

Central Street in recent years has increasingly become a cut through street for traffic in morning rush hour on Route 62 heading toward West Concord and Route 2. When traffic begins to back up at the Pine St/Rte 62 light, drivers turn right off 62 onto Brown St and then left Central St where they then gun their engines and drive at very high speeds down Central. I live at 273 Central St and for the last 20 minutes dozens of cars have been doing this. It is worst between 8-9 am. This is a neighborhood of many children walking and biking to school and the high speeds of these cut through drivers is dangerous and disruptive. It would help if the Concord police would periodically be a visible presence near the Brown St/Central St intersection or on Brown near Rte 62 to deter cut through driving and ticket those who are speeding. Also it would help to put up signs prohibiting cut through traffic between 7:30 -9:30 am and posting speed limit at 20 mph. I've lived in this house for many years and this problem didn't exist until several years ago. Please help.	Other

Utility line down	Other
"Intersection of Redington St, Forest Ave and Greenwood ave.  There are 2 crosswalks at this location, there are no signs indicating they are there and it is dangerous.  Motorists never obey or stop for pedestrians crossing.  Cars travel at a high rate of speed as they approach the stop sign at Redington and Banks.  There is a sign ""stop approaching"" but it is completely obstructed by trees and not visible on the road.  This is a high traffic walking route to school, the issue should be addressed.  Thanks"	Parking and Traffic Concerns
The sidewalk on Cherry St. is still in need of maintenance and clearing.  Only 1/2 of the sidewalk was cleared the week before Halloween 1031/15.  Children are forced to walk in the street, which is very dangerous.	Other
