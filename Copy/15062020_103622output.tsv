After several calls to the police, the previous 'tenants' of the newest hobo hotspot in town had moved on by Sunday afternoon. By Monday morning (today), the junk they left behind was being repurposed by a new occupant (wearing a red shirt), who was busy scouring the surrounding area for more junk as I passed, having evidently previously been moving the road traffic barrier up towards the fence and setting up a 'living area' behind it.

HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY, ALONG WITH ALL OF HIS JUNK.

I knew the leftover junk would attract more and sure enough it did in no time at all. This must be nipped in the bud before we have to go through the same dance of reporting and re-reporting as in other areas.

This always happens—a hobo moves in with minimal stuff, a day later they've collected more stuff to build a more substantial shelter attached to some fixture (fence, light pole, etc), a day after that stolen goods begin appearing (bikes, chairs from nearby Spark, residents' doormats), along with dirty trash dumped onto the sidewalk. Soon after that, they invite friends and the encampment grows.

This growth brings with it a greater sense of confidence and they start doing things like shouting at and intimidating my wife and children as they walk home.

Speaking of which, my wife and children need to walk past this everyday and a child who is not yet fully innoculated is obviously at more considerable risk. It was tiring enough nipping the previous problem in the bud, and it took far too long to see a result. Now we've just moved right onto the next problem.

ENFORCE THE LAW AND REMOVE THIS SEEDLING OF AN ENCAMPMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE IT GROWS OUT OF CONTROL.

If you do not, this is yet another area which will rapidly go downhill.	Encampment

Hi~

At the end of Idlewood Drive, there are some apartments on the other side of the fence. 

There is a hole in the fence and it is causing a lot of foot traffic from the end of Idlewood Drive. 

Many residents have expressed concern with this hole in the fence (or opening) and would like the apartment owners to close up this hole, permanently. 

Many of us have been back there, but cannot see where the hole / opening is.	Private Property Issue

There is a lot of harried activity with trucks full of soil laying out what looks like foundation at the end of Pinehurst Drive & West Woodbury, at end of street where I live. I have called the City of East Point's Development Office to inquire and they simply told me, "I Don't know what it is." The trucks barrel down West Woodbury AND Pinehust in excess of street 25 MPH and are quite rude to the neighbood residents who have to drive the roads which are bad in the first place. Can we please, 1.) Be notified with what they are doing and please find out what they're doing? 2.) Please let Engineers on site and Truckers of Soil bringing soil (in a hurry) to slow down? We have children who live and play in the streets. There are zero sidewalks and zero street drainage which is making for a big mess. Thank you.	Other

1.) Pinehurst Drive (off of Connolly) lacks ANY STORM DRAINAGE on the entire street. Subsequently, when it rains, it pours. The water is saturating MY property as I'm at the bottom of the street towards Mayberry. I have asked the Director of Public Works, as well as spoken with an Assistant at the City Manager's Office near 6 months ago (2019) for help. We require street drainage for water, flooding, the water breaks that pour down towards my property;

2.) Mayberry Street off of Pinehurst Drive is strewn with garbage (e.g., dumped mattresses, clothing, garbage);

3.) H-154 West entrance ramp is Strewn with garbage, papers, water bottles, food trash. Can we please clean up our streets?

About a year or 2 ago, the street was painted, but at that time, the painters forgot to paint in one of the lines up to the point where cars heading south on Stanton were supposed to stop.  Now, the cars are not far up enough for traffic turning West (from Stanton on to the Delowe Connector) to turn.  It causes a HUGE backup for cars turning off of the 166 Connector and turning South on to Stanton and the surrounding streets.  NOW cars are starting to run the light.  It's becoming a huge issue, just because the paint job in the street wasn't finished.	Traffic or Street Sign Issue

At 4:45 PM on 12/11/19, I was proceeding on Martling Ave after waiting at a red light at Martling/Slosson. After a few seconds, my rearview mirror was filled with the bright blue-white headlights of a truck aggressively tailgating me. I was going 25-30 mph. Suddenly the truck crossed the double yellow line into opposite traffic and pulled up alongside me. When I honked, the tow truck cut in front of me and slammed on their brakes to threaten me into an accident. After a few seconds, the truck proceeded, at 10 mph. I took a photo of the license plate when we reached the red light at Martling/Clove Rd. When we made the right turn onto Clove, the tow truck continued to travel at 10 mph on purpose. There was traffic behind me, so I honked. The truck slammed on brakes again, refusing to move for several seconds. The car behind me chose to use the bike lane/shoulder to go around us. When I tried to do the same, the truck revved its engine and wouldn't let me get past. When we reached the light at Clove/Broadway, the car that was behind me and went around was at the red light. I slowed for the red light, knowing that there's no way I would get around the tow truck without getting into a collision. The tow truck sped past the car in front, cut in front, and then turned off its lights to drive dark. It turns out the truck was also going the same direction I was, on Bard (I was far behind the truck at this point due to waiting to make the left turn on Bard) to Forest. On Forest, the tow truck driver narrowly missed hitting a pedestrian and quickly took the right turn onto Metropolitan Ave. The truck is red, and I didn't catch the name of the company that actually owns the truck so I can't complain directly to them. There is a AAA logo across the rear window as well, so I'm issuing a complaint to them as well for this driver's conduct. It was dangerous and absolutely uncalled for. I was terrified. The license plate number is 23186TT.	Other

Old unregistered truck that was towed to this wooded location and green stickered by the police department including the wooded area is becoming an eye sore for the neighborhood.

On the front lawn of 40 South Road (I think it’s 40; it’s the tan house with green shutters, next door to #38 South Road) there has been a broken down vehicle (a white Mercedes) for at least a year. It looks terrible most likely does not run, as no one has driven it in all of the months it’s been sitting there. Can something be done about this? I drive by often and the residents of that house also seem to park most of their working vehicles on the lawn as well. It brings down the property values of homes in the neighborhood and it’s unfair. I believe the white Mercedes got a police ticket once (earlier in 2015), but then someone just slapped a “for sale” sign on the car and continued to leave it there.	Abandoned/Unregistered Vehicles

The fire hydrant on the corner of South Rd and Oakridge Dr is blocked with snow again. It was just cleared YESTERDAY and the Rafferity Garage guys that plow this road just blocked it again.

Someone needs to place a phone call to the owner of that garage. This is happening every time they plow.	Other
At the entrance to the Enfield Public Library there is a rectangular shaped (large) light on the same pole as the street light I believe. This large light keeps coming turning on and off approx. every 5-7 minutes; stays on for perhaps 30 -45 seconds and turns off again. The light appears to be malfunctioning. I don't know who owns or controls this light but it has got to be costing extra money to run it if it keeps going on and off. Please see if you can do something with this issue. Thanks.   p.s. Personally I don't see how that light is necessary anyway. There is a streetlight right there that is working fine. Seems like a waste of money to me.	Streetlight

Three times in the past 3 weeks I've witnessed people driving out of the library parking lot in the wrong direction. They are going out through the entrance. They don't seem to realize it is all One Way once you come in through the entrance. In one instance I was almost hit head on as I was coming in and an elderly couple were driving (too fast) out...coming right at me. I stopped; laid on the horn and waived my hand out the window to get them to stop. I told them it was one way and they were going in the wrong direction...they turned around. I think it's become necessary to put something up that will grab people's attention. Thanks for looking into this.	Public Safety Concerns (Police)

The contractor has encroached on the properties on both sides of the 10’ path leading back to Lot 50.  On the side with Lot 51 the mud & rock are being pushed under the silt fence which has also been pushed over.  On the side with Lot 49, the silt fence was at one time completely torn out, now it was replaced and is over the lot line by 6-12 inches.  There are two places on Lot 51 with standing water after the rain that never happened before.  Damage to the wood fence of Lot 49 has occurred twice.  They also took it upon themselves to remove the cover to the cable box by the street and bury the cable connections under the rock for the drive to the site rather than having the utility company move it properly.  This eventually caused cables to be cut and service disconnected.	Grading Violation

South Shore Bus Service Taken Away

Hi Jimmy:
With the new Staten Island bus routes and schedules planned for later this month. I would like to know why the South Shore of the Island has been forgotten in this latest restructure. As you know I work for a major media company in Manhattan and my stop neat my home is Woodrow Road & Arden Ave. I usually arrive at the location between 1:15 AM and 1:30 AM. Now with the new route plan. The last stop is the Eltingville Transit Center. I am by no means leaving new vehicle in a lot loaded with homeless people sleeping in the center and outside as well as drug activity in the area all the time.

Check the MTA ridership. There are many, many people who take this line to get to ANNADALE, ARDEN HGTS and HUGUENOT. 

They cannot stop this service. 
Hope you can be of assistance in this issue.

Look forward to hearing from you.	MTA Bus Complaint

A car failed to negotiate the curve at an entrance to Pardee Seawall Park. It took out a number of the barrier posts designed to stop cars from entering the park. There is now a wide open area that will allow the next out of control vehicle to continue into the park unimpeded. The barrier posts need to be replaced ASAP before another driver loses control on that curve.	Parks Request
Two days ago, my wife and I spent over an hour of our time picking up and removing garbage from the rock beach at the end of the Pardee seawall.  This morning, just two days later we walk to the end of the seawall to find that someone (or a group of people/kids) had flipped over the cement garbage container and dumped EVERYTHING (a huge overflowing garbage can's worth) into the water!!  This is the same garbage can that we put our bags of collected trash into just two days earlier... and could now SEE them back floating in the water! Along with just a TON of other trash... the whole beach is totally covered! 

Honestly I've had ENOUGH of this (and we see it every summer)!  As a community, we should be OUTRAGED! I do not understand how someone could do this with no thought to what it does to RUIN this beautiful area we get to live in and need to work together to protect. Most of all we should be concerned over the generational impacts it will have on the quality of the water and wildlife in our area...  Enjoy fishing on the new pier? Or kayaking along the shoreline? Or swimming at Lighthouse Point? Now dump a can of garbage on it.

As I see it, three things need to happen:

1. The Parks Department NEEDS to increase its pickup and collection of trash.  We've seen other posts showing the constant overflowing of trash in the park's containers and on the new fishing pier. We walk on the seawall every day, and just yesterday we were commenting on how all the trash cans were overflowing once again. We can't continue letting these bins become targets for vandals/people who have nothing better to do with their time than ruin good things for everyone else.  I also will be reporting this on SeeClickFix.

2.  We need to increase our presence of policing, whether that's more NHPD in the Cove at night (which probably won't happen) or simply having more neighbors keeping a watch on our streets and parks and stepping up to say something! I myself stopped a couple of teenagers who were destroying property on that same beach just two days ago (the same day we initially picked up the garbage). Maybe we should think about forming a more organized neighborhood watch at this point?

3. Parents need to talk to their children and teens about the costs and effects of vandalism and hold them accountable to cleaning up their messes. I don't know for a fact who dumped the garbage into the water, but I can tell you we have seen a couple of groups of teens in the park late at night all this week (mostly getting high on the same benches that are right next to that knocked over garbage can).  This behavior needs to be stopped. If it were my kid, I would want to know... and I can tell you, they would be down there cleaning it up right now.

I know everyone on here loves Morris Cove as much as we do... we have to do everything we can to protect it.	Illegal Dumping

A light at this location and 4 additional lights to the south have been on during the day.  One day I was looking at them to see for sure if they were on during the day, and they all the sudden went off.  Then a subsequent day, they were on during the day again.  Duke Energy says they are not their lights.  I had thought you worked out a deal where the city and Duke Energy communicate about these things so they are reported one time, but instead Duke called me to tell me these are not their lights (even though I believe they are on their website map).

When we have food delivered to our home, we never use the utensils given to us. If we could opt out, we would. I have a drawer filled with items I'll never use and can't recycle and didn't even want in the first place. I'm not saying ban utensils completely, but give customers I way to opt out. I'm also writing to delivery services to see if they can add a feature to their programs. Thanks for your time.	Other

I am requesting that DOT install speed bumps on Hamilton Street NE between South Dakota Ave NE AND 7th Street NE.  Cars regularly speed at extremely high speeds as they travel from South Dakota Ave NE to Eastern Ave NE using Hamilton St NE, especially during evening rush hour and in the evening.  I have two infant children (8.5 month olds) and it is extremely unsafe to buckle them in and remove their car seats from the car with cars speeding both ways.  Once they begin walking I know this fear and danger will be compounded.  There are also many other young children and elderly people living on this block that are also in danger of being hit by speeding cars directly in front of their homes.

There are speed bumps on Hamilton St NE between 7th and 8th St NE and cars make an effort to slow down. In addition, there are speed bumps on neighboring Ingraham street, which sees far less car traffic, and on Galloway, a busy throughfare street.  Both speed bump installations have decreased speeding and keep residents safe.  I request that our block of Hamilton Street NE be afforded the same opportunity for safety.  Thank you for your consideration.	Traffic Safety Investigation

Loose gravel coming up through recently repaired roads in Fall of 2018: The roads in our HOA were recently done in the Fall of 2018. And while I greatly appreciate them being patched and re-sealed I believe the final coat was either not done or was not done correctly, possibly to thin. Immediately following the completion of our community roads gravel was coming up. At times it sounds like you are driving on a gravel road instead of one recently sealed. Black Horse Ranch community is separated into three sections. I would like to meet with someone from Pima County Road Maintenance in person to review the roads within our HOA community and try to understand what is happening to roads that Pima County/Cholla Pavement just resealed. 
This is my second request. I sent photo's previously and was told it was dirt from construction in a cul-de-sac off of E Canter Rd and Golder Ranch Rd. If it was happening in that area only then I would agree. Unfortunately, is happening in all three of the sections. In the N Twin Lakes Dr section, N Gwynns Run DR section and the N Rugged Lark Dr section. I did contact Cholla pavement first and was told I would need to contact Pima County. And while the photo attached was taken off of E Wilds Rd and N Gwynns Run Dr it does not really matter as you can take this same photo throughout our community and they would all look the same.

Despite Public Works digging a slight trench in my front yard during the second week of January, 2016 (as part of an effort to regrade Grove Hill), I am once again having drainage problems. The trench was not deep enough to allow my yard to drain adequately; hence, rainwater builds up quickly and pushes the water back toward my house filling up my septic system. I would appreciate a re-digging of the ditch -- hopefully a bit deeper to help alleviate the problem. Thank you so much for your attention to this matter! -- Karen Davis	Ditch Maintenance

A year or so ago, the city came through and did some pipe work under the raod corners.  They finished up one day and put down what I'd assumed was a temporary patch over the hole.  But that same cheap fill is still there, anx at this point it's crumbled into dirt.  I've a two year old.  This is NOT helpful.  Please send someone to finally fill the hole properly.  Thanks.

We've got a brick alley between 5th and 6th streets N, running N-S.  It's got ruts literally a foot deep all along it.  The rits are so deep that I can't get my car across them amd into our driveway without scraping the bottom of the car up.  It also doesn't drain, so all rainy season, there are foot-deep puddles the while length of the street.  Trying to get into a car with a baby in your hand in ankle deep water has gotten old.  Please, can you send someone to resurface/level this alley?	Alley Blading/Smoothing
a street light at this corner is heavily blocking by low tree branches that make the streetlight almost pointless. It is very difficult to see while walking on the sidewalks due to the darkness.

I have reported this MANY times and the lights are still on during the day.  It was explained that there is a sensor that turns them on and offer, and that maybe the trees are blocking the light causing them to be on during the day, etc. etc. etc.  What that person seems to not understand is that IF they lights are on during a sunny day, SOMETHING is wrong.  The senor can't be working properly or it is being interfered with and it should be corrected.  Why on earth is someone saying there is no problem over and over again?  

Once again.  As simple as possible:  If the lights are on during a bright, sunny day, SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY!  

If the city just does not care and is not going to fix this, than just say that instead of saying it is working properly.	City Park Maintenance

Bush at the corner of 6th Avenue north and 6th street north is right on the corner.  It blocks drivers views and it also overhangs the sidewalk and it has thorns so it's hazardous to walk by as well.

The recent hurricane knocked over our neighbor's tree.  It's laying against the garage of another neighbor and over our house.   The problem is, it's also laying directly on top of a live power line, pushing it down toward my roof.  My two neighbors despise one another and flat out won't pay to take the tree down.  (We're willing to pay 1/3 the cost, but neither of the others is.)  The tree is a fire hazard as is.  How can I get at least the part touching the power lines removed, to keep my own house safe, without depending on either idiot neighbor?  Duke Energy claims trees touching power lines are not their business.   Is this really true?	Tree Trimming/Removal

The crosswalk signal at the NE corner of the intersection (Patchen/Williston Rds) is not operating. When the crosswalk button is pushed, we hear 'wait'....but no amount of waiting is going to result in the ability to cross Williston or Patchen Rd.

The crosswalk signal is not working and everyone who uses this #1 bus stop is aware that it has not worked since the pole was struck by a vehicle. That's a very, very long time.

The only way to safely cross over to the NW corner (with a #12 bus stop and a working crosswalk signal) is to walk down Patchen Road to be a safe distance from vehicles turning off Williston Road and then cautiously crossing the street before backtracking to the intersection.

I'll feel more comfortable if this report remains 'open' until somebody has actually looked into it and a repair has been scheduled/made. This is a long overdue issue that many bus ridesr/pedestrians at this intersection are talking about.	Signals

Just south of 3868 Wedgefield Circle (just south of Hilton Dr), Decatur, the County dug up a pipe, filled in the hole and left the red dirt/mud with a very bad pothole. Just north of the same 3868 Wedgefield Circle address, another pipe was dug up a year ago and a metal plate was installed. A crew finally fixed that pothole last week, however, they dragged the big metal plate to the north of that hole and left it there. They could have put that plate over the pothole to the south and solved two problems with one expensive visit by several County trucks to Wedgefield Cir. It doesn't make sense. Cars are having to swerve at the pothole AND at the metal plate to keep from damaging their cars.	Other

Improper operation of traffic signal at corner of Whitney and Hawthorne avenues
Sometimes this traffic light stays green on Hawthorne for far too long and even when no car approaches on it and nobody presses the pedestrian signal. This isn't traffic calming; it just causes wasting of fuel and could make some drivers run the red light. The behavior is erratic; sometimes the signal operates properly. I'll try to post a photo of the traffic backup.	General Issues
This traffic light sometimes cycles with approximately equal green time on each street even when no cars approach on Hawthorne and there is of course much more traffic on Whitney. When it does, traffic can back up for over 2 blocks as the picture shows. The problem is exacerbated because on-street parking there reduces traffic on Whitney to one lane. This behavior is erratic; sometimes it behaves properly, staying green on Whitney until a vehicle approaches on Hawthorne. The strange behavior does nothing to improve safety and only causes vehicles to waste fuel.	General Issues
There has been no street sign on this corner for several years now. Even with the wide availability of navigation systems, signs are essential for those unfamiliar with the neighborhood.	General Issues

How much longer is the city going to leave the stretch of Main St. heading east between Poe's Pub and the Wharf unmarked? The intersection of Main St. and Williamsburg Rd. is already a problem area as folks turning left onto Williamsburg Rd. have a bad habit of starting their turn early or "rounding it off". I have had a couple semi close calls there in the past. It has been nearly a month since this stretch of road was repaved. It is high time the road markings were redone. This spot is already an accident waiting to happen. The lack of road markings just makes it that much worse. I would also suggest a "TURN HERE" sign on the pavement for the folks turning left on Williamsburg Rd.	Other
The north bound lane of Wiliamsburg Road right after you pass 31st and just before you make the turn onto Main (by what would have been the stop light and bus stop) there are pot holes. Two have been filled although the fill is shallow, but the uneven dip and hole of another pothole that is there still is disruptive to the traffic flow because you are trying to avoid the wall there to the right and with the pot hole, your car will go over into the other lane when you hit it or when other cars attempt to avoid it. It is a public safety threat and risk..  One is large enough to do serious damage to a tire and wheel and if you lose control to harm a persons  walking and running up Libby HIll.	Pothole

At the intersection of 13th & U street NW heading north bound, there needs to be roadway markings that indicate who is to turn left, go straight, or turn right. Many times drivers "take up" all the lanes because it's difficult to tell who is going where. Is the driver going to turn left - then I should get in the right lane, or is the driver going strraight - then I should get behind him, or is the driver going to turn right, then I don't want to get behind him. NO ONE uses their signal, you figure it out when the light turns green and the cars move. Clear markings will help alliviate the problems. It looks like there is plenty of room for two lanes, one for a left turn and one for straight or turn right. JUST LIKE THE SOUTH BOUND side.	Roadway Striping / Markings

We are hoping that we can get that done in the near future as it is a very dark road for walking, security etc. We do realize there are other pending and probably more important tasks at hand but we hold out hope.

There is a stop sign at this location that is facing southbound but is on the other side of an intersection. It is confusing exactly where to stop since if you stop exactly where the sign is, you have already passed/are in the middle of the intersection. The signs should be moved so it's clear exactly who should stop for whom and where. 

By the way, the exact location of the stop sign is directly east of Arby's, where one of the entrances to Arby's, a road leading from Old Wake Forest Rd to Capital Blvd, and a third road that goes behind the strip mall intersect.	Signals / Signs
The stop sign by the Arby's on Capital Boulevard seems to be placed incorrectly. The stop sign is placed in the middle of an intersection of two roads, so stopping in front of the stop sign leaves you in the intersection.

Dead raccoon in bike lane on side of road beside the school	Other
Since the closure of the fitness dome, trucks, I assume from neighboring businesses, have begun parking on both sides of Bridle Gate drive. I am not sure why this has happened since the dome closed since it seems Parking would have been more of an issue when it was open and had customers parking there. The vehicles parked on both sides of the road are mostly large trucks, some with attached trailers that have other vehicles on top of the trailers. This makes for poor sight lines to see oncoming traffic when trying to turn on to Bridle Gate drive from Bridle Trails, Bridle Ct or the Highway 6 frontage road. It has also caused near head on collisions when vehicles are traveling between these parked cars toward the frontage road and another vehicle turns on to Bridle Gate drive from the frontage road at a high rate of speed.

There are dust clouds during wind gusts blown from the construction site across Rock Prairie Rd. between Old Rock Prairie Rd and Stonebrook Dr.
These clouds are very much like a sand storm. Not only that they contaminate the surrounding houses, but they also create health hazard (breathing) and driving hazards (decreased visibility).

I hope that something can be done about this.

There is a road construction going on and off for many weeks on Faulkner Dr. (It's slowly moving from Woodcreek Dr. toward Frost Dr.).

This has created numerous problems in the area, most, if not all due to the lack of diligence on the construction crew.
1. First, for many weeks there were loose gravel and debris on Woodcreek Dr., several hundred yards (all the way to Waterford Dr.) from the actual construction site. So, as you drive on Woodcreek, you get all that garbage beating on the bottom of the car.
To be fair, they did clean up at the end of the day, but driving day time was like driving through a construction site, even though it was some 3 blocks away.

2. They do not post signs that the road is close (and at times it is effectively closed). 
E.g. today, I was driving from Woodcreek Dr. toward Frost Dr., and the crew was working between Finney Cir and Frost Dr. One have of the pavement was lifted and blocked by the crew and the machinery, while the other half was freshly laid, and still sticky. One of the crew members was some 50-70 ft. in front of the site, giving gestures to slow down.
He directed me to drive through that still sticky pavement. I just had new tires installed 3 days ago, and I that staff ruins tires. I had to drive back to Stonebrook Dr., Rock Prairie Rd. and back to Bird Pond Rd.
Because of that, my kid was late for the sports class.

3. This construction has been going for enormous amount of time. The heavy machinery is coming all the time and they are not always the most courteous or careful. E.g. this morning, I had a dump truck that was tailgating my car, while I was driving on Woodcreek Dr. at the speed limit (30 mph). 

4. Further down, the pavement was removed from Frost Dr. (between Faulkner and Bird Pond Dr.) and no work was going there for weeks.

Could you please,
a) make sure that there is a proper signage and diversion of traffic when the work is in effect, and improve overall safety
b) post the period of the road work so that people are aware (how many months?)
c) complete the work on Frost Dr. ASAP?	Other

How many unsafe cars are on the street because of this STICKER Company.  This car at 9206 Shadowcrest Drive has not moved for over 8 months.

When cars are turning right from 100 Boyett Street onto University Drive, drivers leaving from 306 University Dr. from Hallabaloo Hall (turning left onto University) are disregarding the right away for the cars turning right on green lights and are almost hitting cars in the right lane.  When they make their left hand turn they are cutting across sharply into the furthest right hand lane.  On several occasions I have witnessed near accidents, especially at heavy traffic peak hours (rush hour times).  Can an advance green be put on the traffic signal turning left from Hullabaloo Hall?

I visited Dat Dog at 101 Church Ave, Suite 1200, College Station Texas  77840 on August 17, 2019 at approximately 2 pm - 3 pm.  Due to there being limited parking in front of the building we parked in the paid parking lot down the street.  As we were leaving the restaurant, I walked out onto the sidewalk to make my way to the parking lot.  There is a 2-tier sidewalk right out front. The surface closest to the building is one level and then the surface closest to the road has a gradual slope to it.  I did not see the 2nd layer and stepped off and broke my right foot.  Has this happened before?  This has got to be a hazard.  I do not drink, I can see well and it was clear weather but this was not something I could see as I walked.  Thank you for your response.

There are several locations along the length of Welsh Avenue (I notice it most when northbound) where tree branches are hanging down into the bike lane.  This forces cyclists to take the car lane, which is upsetting to drivers and a hazard.  I will create issues for places I particularly noticed (this is location 1), but it is probably most efficient if the entire length of Welsh Avenue is checked for this maintenance need.  Thank you!

I previously reported 4 instances of branches in the bike lane along Welsh Avenue.  One instance was resolved quickly and I commented as such (I think probably the gas station management itself took care of that one).  The other three instances were closed without any apparent effort to resolve them and are now archived so I cannot reopen them.  I will ask (again) that you please make the bike lanes safe to travel in by trimming the trees that have branches that force bikes into the car lanes.  The remaining three locations are near the intersections of Welsh and -Honeysuckle, -San Mario, and -Westchester.  If you can't find the branches I reference, please comment as such rather than closing the issue without addressing it.  I will be happy to make a point of stopping along my commute to take photos if necessary.	Other

Dockless bike on Victoria near Eagle.	Dockless Bike Share
1) My understanding is the city had to relocate the bike lane/trail from Lick Creek to Eagle Ave to Longmire Dr.   The bike lanes have now been recently painted on Eagle Ave with the center double yellow line.   Vehicles are parking in the bike lane on Eagle Ave near Victoria and on Eagle Ave across from school.    Will signs be added later restricting vehicles from parking on Eagle Ave in the bike lanes?  
2) Notice for about 3 weeks now during the early morning hours with the joggers (5:30am) in the neighborhood, there must be a street light circuit out because not all the street lights are shining especially on Eagle Ave near the school between Alexandria and the curve at Creekside Circle.  This is currently the undeveloped area and it is dark on both sides of Eagle.   Looks like every other street light is out.
Thanks!	Other
Victoria Ave has a lot of traffic on it and there are many elementary kids crossing it every morning and afternoon to get to school.   A cross walk, a crossing guard and/or maybe a speed bump would be helpful.   There is a lot of speeding on Victoria, exacerbating the problem.

I would like to write a formal complaint about our experience with Housing Inspector Wayne Grenard. My husband and I are a young couple and bought a historic home in Ferguson to renovate into our dream home. During the first few months we decided to get a fence. Wayne made the whole process extremely difficult for us. We had to jump through many hoops to get the permits. We used Chesterfield Fencing Company and they said Wayne requested items from them they have never been asked about for a residential fence. He was very rude to me over the phone and on the day we were supposed to get the fence installed Wayne did not approve it so the whole project had to be pushed back a week. I had already taken off work the day of the project so I missed out on a day of pay. Wayne was very rude to me throughout the process so I handed the situation over to my husband. My husband went up to the City Hall to talk to Wayne and he was very rude to him as well. After the fence finally got installed my father was at our home one day and Wayne came over because he left a measuring stick at our home. He was very confrontational towards my dad while asking for the stick. I have talked to many neighbors and all have had similar issues with Wayne. It is very discouraging that a city that would like to rebuild and attract young families would knowingly keep employing someone who continuously deters young families from wanting to invest in their homes. When I drive around my neighborhood there are houses falling apart and abandoned. Its hard to believe under those circumstances that Wayne would have time to hassle residents who are installing a $10,000 fence. Overall my experience was so poor I felt compelled to share it with Wayne's supervisors. Thanks	Helping A Neighbor

This issue has been reported on here for 2 years. It is however reported under an incorrect house number. The issues are at 917 N Broad St and it is appalling that the city has found no resolution in 2 years.  I do not comprehend how you issue violations and offer excuses of the owner cannot afford to fix any of the problems. The city offers several options to its residents. Trash pickup, compost site, spring and fall pickup... The list goes on and on. Laws and ordinances were not established for city workers to enforce them at their own discretion. It is a simple system, follow the laws and ordinances or be found in violation and progress from there if notice of violations are ignored.  Saying the owner cannot afford to fix the issues is absurd.  Issue the tickets and then follow up and continue to issue tickets until they are resolved.  The fairgrounds just did a recycle on tires.  Yet over 40 tires are stacked in their yard. STOP condoning laziness. When the city had spring clean up for free, these people couldn't move some of the rubbish 10 feet to the curb for a free service?  Maybe it is a conflict of interest to have the code enforcer being supervised by an over worked city prosecutor.  Is the code enforcer pushing the issues that need to addressed or ignoring issues to lighten the case load for our city attorney?	Blight

Street - Traffic Signal Concern 
Location and Description of the problem 
Tree foliage blocks a school zone flashing light for Irving School.  Drivers who turn from 20th onto Eastbound Van Dorn are unable to see the flashing school zone light located east of Irving School on the north side of Van Dorn, well past 22nd Street (about 2300 Van Dorn). PLEASE inspect this issue when the light is flashing: drive north on 20th Street to the intersection with Van Dorn.  Turn right/East.  Look for the flashing light and note how far you have to travel before it is visible (probably you will be in the block East of the school, almost entirely past the school zone).  As long as trees have foliage, this school zone flashing light is entirely ineffective.  It would be great to have this issue addressed for the safety of the Irving School students.  Thank you very much.	Traffic Signal Concern / Signal Burned Out

This residence is channeling water from the property out across the sidewalk. There's a large patch that's never dry. It's growing algae or mold or something, and killing the grass on the other side of the walkway. It's unpleasant to walk through and it's been a problem for months, and it will be a hazard when winter comes. There's been a similar issue here before which was fixed, but something must have "backed up."	Residential Property Maintenance

The SIM1 service has been very bad for commuters going home. It has led to 20-minute waits and overcrowded buses. There are four SIM4 buses for every SIM1.

South Shore Bus Service Taken Away

Hi Jimmy:
With the new Staten Island bus routes and schedules planned for later this month. I would like to know why the South Shore of the Island has been forgotten in this latest restructure. As you know I work for a major media company in Manhattan and my stop neat my home is Woodrow Road & Arden Ave. I usually arrive at the location between 1:15 AM and 1:30 AM. Now with the new route plan. The last stop is the Eltingville Transit Center. I am by no means leaving new vehicle in a lot loaded with homeless people sleeping in the center and outside as well as drug activity in the area all the time.

Check the MTA ridership. There are many, many people who take this line to get to ANNADALE, ARDEN HGTS and HUGUENOT. 

They cannot stop this service. 
Hope you can be of assistance in this issue.

Look forward to hearing from you.	MTA Bus Complaint

Good morning,
My driveway, along with my 3 neighbors has been plowed in. It is about 4-5 feet of snow and not something that can be dug out with a shovel.

Grass is growing along curbs and the cracks of the sidewalks around this building particularly on Greenwood Avenue and Wickham Street.  Contractors cut the grass on the property, but have yet to get rid of the grass growing on the concrete sidewalk and curbs.  It needs a type of weed killer.

Right in front of my driveway. This pothole is getting bigger every day.

I've reported this pothole multiple times before in last couple months - case 2382389 and 2448629.

I would like the thank the Public Works Dept. for their prompt response yesterday, 10/01/2015, in draining the water from Ocean View Ave.  However, I would like to point out that until the 'pumps' (if there are any) have been fixed, the flood problem will continue. The roadway was flooded again within one hour after you left yesterday. Here is a picture of the area this morning.	Roadway Flooded
The ditches and the culverts on Horn Point Road are all clogged and do not allow the water to drain/flow.  Anytime it rains or we get the slightest Southern wind the water covers the street from ditch to ditch.  I was told at the meeting held at the Senior Center on 10/04/18 that there is no money in the budget to clean the ditches but that seems ridiculous to me so I hope that I was told some incorrect information. When I first moved to Horn Point in 2012 there was only an occasional flooding.  Now it seems like it is a constant occurrence and a dry road is an occasional occurrence.  We need the city's help out here!  we really need our ditches and culverts cleaned out so there is a place for the water to flow through so that it is not in our streets and our yards and our houses!!  And we need you to stop pumping Asheville Park's flooding problem into Back Bay and making it a problem for us.  We cannot handle any more water out here.	Stormdrain Maintenance
The entire street, from the beginning to the end of Horn Point Road, is crumbling.  I have called it potholes but the situation is much worse than that.  The whole street is deteriorating and each time it rains and/or floods we lose a little more of our street into the ditches.	Pothole
A concerned homeowner walking his dog over the past week or so  noted the below street lights burned out/inoperative: 1824 Fury Way, N1111 XL93, 1872/1876 Champion Circle (between mailboxes, no pole #) 1825/1829 Champion Circle (cycles on, then out, no pole #) 1853/1857 Champion Circle (cycles on, then out, no pole #) 1769 Champion Circle (by traffic circle) N1211 DJ14 Also, in front of 1720 Beauty Way, there is overgrown shrubbery blocking the sidewalk. At 1972 Champion Circle, which I believe is unoccupied, the back porch has some sort of wooden cover which has been blown down. I'm not sure if this is something that we as an association should be concerned with, other than it looks bad, as if the home has been deserted.	Street Light
They just stripped my street for new pavement.  In front of the storm drain between 5633 and 5629 Quarterpath Gate, there is a 2 inch whole that opens to a large hole.  This should probably be filled in before they cover it up when they pave the street.	Other Roadway Issues
Want to let you know that one of the homeowners had a tree cut down and half of it almost completely blocks the drainage canal just downstream of Ludlow Drive.  It will completely back up the canal during heavy rain and will catch/block every bit of litter that floats down the canal.  The remainder of the tree is laying on the bank which will restrict city access down the canal as well. Simpson Tree Service cut it down, but instead of dropping it on the bank, he let half of it fall directly into the canal.  Simpson said he was only paid to cut it, not remove it as the homeowner said he would do it.  It has been there for a month now!
 You can best see the problem from Ludlow Drive as it passes over the canal just off Pissarro Drive.  The owner lives on Latique Circle.

At the intersection of Historic Forbis and North Church (N-S) and Summit Avenue (E-W) only the vehicles on the North end tend to follow their lanes and turn properly.  At all the other ends of this intersection, traffic commonly signals to turn or gets into a dedicated turning lane and then change their minds at the last minute.

The danger to pedestrians is clear because they can be caught in the traffic with a car bearing down on them regardless of the lights or driver signals.

I once observed this with Jeremiah from Engineering and Inspections in the past months as he surveyed for the Summit Avenue Streetscapes project at this intersection.  Because I observed this over the past several months, I wanted to report this dangerous intersection now before someone gets hurt.

I feel that the lanes and street markings are adequate, but drivers refuse to follow them anyway.  Perhaps the City can consider adding some of those round half-baseball lane markers to remind drivers to stay committed to their own signalling and the dedicated turning lanes they are keeping in.
A little jolt and bump from crossing those markers may help.	Other

I’m not sure what it takes to get something done. I know this isn’t a big item on your plate but I first corresponded with you in July. It’s now October. The problem is worse now than it was in July. Cyclists are now swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt from the driveway. It’s in the Midnight Pass/Higel curve. Eventually someone will get hurt. Cars routinely cut that corner with their right side tires in the bike lane – I know all too well as I was knocked off my bike by one right in that corner as I was riding in the bike lane. 
 
Combine cars with their tires in the bike lane with cyclists swerving into the roadway to avoid the dirt and you have a big accident waiting to happen.
 
Please take some action on this.	Road or Bridge Issue

Many surrounding neighbors have been complaining for a long time and now something needs to be done. The residents have 2 large dogs that they leave out for long periods of time, and they bark most of the time. It often occurs before 8am and after 10pm, and during the weekends it is very obnoxious as well. Please give them some kind of warning now, with the intent that it could lead to a fine if it continues. The owners don't even attempt to stop it, and often encourage it if they see they are barking at other animals.	Other
The entire stretch of road on NE 2nd avenue is littered with potholes from 60th to 40th street. It is a huge hazard, I already dipped into a pothole on my scooter, fell onto the road and suffered injuries. There are also NO LANES painted onto the road on either side, so there are no lanes separating the north and south flow of traffic nor are there lanes separating traffic on the same side. People are constantly swerving across the road as there are no lanes and are often driving onto the opposite side of the road. This is INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS!! Please fix!!	Traffic Flow & Congestion

Good morning.  After waking up today and starting to get my young children ready to school, I realized that I now live on a race track.  Students and faculty are flying up Riverview Street going double the speed limit.  This is a quiet neighborhood with many young children.  Can we get an officer to address the speed here both at the beginning of school and the dismissal time, please.  Maybe if we address this at the beginning of the year it may reduce it for the rest of the school year.  Thank you very much and have a great morning.	Speeding

Exterior Site Lighting Glare - Nuisance - Light Trespass 04-14-2014

To Whom It May Concern:

There is an unshielded spotlight located at 12 Holiday Lane, Enfield, Connecticut 06082 [Owners: KARAKLA CLARENCE J + MARY K] which is causing lighting glare and trespasses across the neighborhood property lines during most nights. This ongoing nuisance disturbs the peace and tranquility and degrades the quality of life that negatively impacts nearby residents.

The spotlight is mounted on the garage side of the house and should be hooded as well as pointed down and to not reflect off of any building materials, so that the lens is not visible and the light cast does not project outside the property line in order to meet the code.

This fixture creates a strong night time light glare in my backyard and house windows at night.
Absolutely, there is no reason in the world that this spotlight should remain on continuously from dust until dawn which it has on many occasions for a very long time. I strongly believe this practice has to stop because it really borders on harassment.

Installation of this lighting fixture was initiated long after the establishment of the following ordinance:

Enfield Town Code
Section 7.10.6 Outdoor Lighting.
All external illumination shall be directed or shielded in such a manner that the source (bulb, tube, etc.) of light will not be visible from any street or from any adjoining property. No light shall be directed outside the lot where it originates. All lighting shall be shielded or otherwise designed to provide down lighting so as to minimize night glare.

Therefore, I am asking that you please take the appropriate action to bring this lighting violation into compliance so that we can all sleep in peace.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.	Zoning Code Violation
Miss use of pedestrian crossing street sign.
The sign is on the ground leaning up against the brick built mailbox structure.  There is no cross walk in the area where a pedestrian crossing sign should be needed let alone be on the ground.  Signs are always on posts.  It should be removed from the area.	Street Signs
All these years the mill has been here making the wooden cable reels and storing the assembled ones on their property on Oak St on both sides of Randolph St stacked 4 to 5 high in a large area until they are needed and then transported out to the various places that have purchased them.
Has any one ever thought of the possibility of them falling over?  They could fall due to the high winds, rain or snow or just because they were not balanced when stacked.  They could fall over in to their surroundings which may be a passing vehicle or person walking by or a worker in the lot.
Should there be a tall fence to support the height and amount of reels?   Should they just not be stacked as high?
It would be nice if some one could check in to this even though nothing has happened all of these years - but they did have a fire not too long ago if you recall.	Zoning Code Violation

A large orange state posted construction liability ahead sign is still posted in this location of Hazard Avenue and Holiday Lane.  The project in the vicinity of Powder Hollow Brewery and the clearing of the dam is completed with all of the Jersey barriers and signage removed.  It seems that this sign was forgotten about and should be removed since there is no construction ahead any more.	Public Construction Projects
A stretch of chain link fence was damaged over the summer during tree work.   It's getting worse recently...  Also the run of sidewalk and guard rail here  is badly in need of a trimming.	Sidewalks
This home has two unused/unregistered cars in the fenced yard covered in tarps, one red and one yellow. There is also a blue tuck that has a smashed in front end and a bed full of trash that is unused and has been sitting there for months.  Can anything be done about this eyesore in our neighborhood?

Zoning Violation – Rear Yard Spotlights Project Beyond Property Line – 10 Holiday Lane
At 10 Holiday Lane there are motion sensor duel spotlights positioned at the rear of the house of which the lighting projects beyond the property line and lights up the surrounding properties [yards and buildings] along Longview Road at all hours of most nights for the longest time now.
This situation is not reasonable or acceptable for a residential area. It maybe alright for parking lots or airports.
A few things need to change for this lighting to become into full compliance with the Enfield zoning lighting ordinance such as:
1.	The spotlights must be adjusted so that the main light cast does not project beyond the owner’s property line.
2.	The spotlights should be shielded [hooded] in such a manner so that they do not glare outwards against other surrounding dwellings which is different than the main cast of light.
3.	The spotlights sensor(s) be adjusted to an extent as much as possible so that it reduces the amount of times the lights are tripped on and off again at multiple times.
4.	The spotlights do not run all night long nor most hours of every night.
5.	The spotlights are pointed so that the lights do not reflect against a bright building surface that they are mounted on which can also broadcast any nuisance light glare outwards at even a wider angle.
Therefore, it is requested that zoning enforcement serve notice to have these changes made as soon as possible.
Thank You.	Zoning Code Violation

Backyard spotlights behind 10 Holiday Lane which are on most nights of any week have bulbs that are not shielded that is in violation of:
Enfield Town Code
Section 7.10.6 Outdoor Lighting.
All external illumination shall be directed or shielded in such a manner that the source (bulb, tube, etc.) of light will not be visible from any street or from any adjoining property. No light shall be directed outside the lot where it originates. All lighting shall be shielded or otherwise designed to provide down lighting so as to minimize night glare.
Please have the resident add shields around the bulbs to comply with the code and have them stop running the lights at all hours on most nights of every week.	Zoning Code Violation
Rear yard motion sensor double spotlights are projecting beyond the property line from 10 Holiday Lane into my back windows, yard and house.
These lights also go on and off many times during the evening hours which degrades the enjoyment of my property.
This is the 3rd time for this complaint.
Please make sure that these lights are shut down this time until the violation is corrected.
Enough is enough already!	Zoning Code Violation

This is the second time for this complaint.
The first time after this issue was reported and acted upon, conditions improved quite a bit but not entirely for awhile, gradually returning back to where it started.
Every time the wind blows, branches sway, raindrops, snow and night falls, the lights turn on and project the glare past the property line on through to other surrounding homes which in effect, when occurring repeatedly, essentially makes this also a breach of peace in an R33 Zone.

The original message is repeated below with some clarifications and additions:

2. The spotlights shielded [hooded] in such a manner so that they do not glare outwards against other surrounding dwellings in a way so that the bulbs cannot be seen from other properties which is different than the main cast of light.

3. The spotlights sensor(s) be eliminated or adjusted to such an extent as much as possible so that it greatly reduces the amount of times the lights are tripped on and off again at multiple times, in which this is extremely annoying.

4. The spotlights do not run continuously all night long nor most hours of every night.

5. The spotlights are pointed downwards in a manner so that the lights do not reflect against a bright building surface that they are mounted onto which can also broadcast any nuisance light glare outwards at even a wider angle.

Therefore, it is requested that zoning enforcement serve notice to have these changes made as soon as possible and follow up to insure compliance is met on the above 5 listed points as well as report the completed progress made by the homeowner from Zoning Enforcement inspection before closing the issue on this website.
