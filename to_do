Need to find a way to make the older version of drivers run with NeMo. 

The problem can be solved by either getting an old version of NeMo from github (which I haven't been able to do yet) or asking Tamal Maharaj to update the drivers. 
I feel that I should try out absolutely everything I can before talking to Purnendu Da or Tamal Maharaj. 

First task to figure out before I begin the next session is to figure out how to clone older branches of the master branch.
I also need to study more about RNN, encoder-decoder algorithms, RNNs with LSTMs and ofcourse attention mechanisms.
I should also try to get the tensorflow nmt example running on my local machine.
